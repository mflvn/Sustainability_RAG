# Industry Description

The Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) & Original Design Manufacturing (ODM) industry consists of two main segments. EMS companies provide assembly, logistics, and after-market services for original equipment manufacturers. The ODM segment of the industry provides engineering and design services for original equipment manufacturers and may own significant intellectual property. Although EMS & ODM companies produce equipment for a variety of sectors, the industry is closely associated with the hardware industry, which consists of companies that design technology hardware products such as personal computers, consumer electronics, and storage devices for both personal consumers and businesses.

Note: The Electronic Manufacturing Services & Original Design Manufacturing industry does not include the design of technology hardware products. Companies that design and manufacture technology hardware products should consider the separate SASB Hardware Industry Standard (TC-HW) in addition to the SASB Electronic Manufacturing Services & Original Design Manufacturing Industry Standard (TC-ES).

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

The manufacturing of computers, computer components, and other electronics requires significant volumes of water. Water is becoming a scarce resource around the globe, due to increasing consumption from population growth and rapid urbanization, and reduced supplies due to climate change. Without careful planning, water scarcity can result in higher supply costs, social tensions with local communities and governments, and/or loss of access to water in water-scarce regions thereby presenting a critical risk to production, and thus revenues. Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) & Original Design Manufacturing (ODM) companies that are able to increase the efficiency of water use during manufacturing can reduce operating costs and maintain a lower risk profile, ultimately impacting cost of capital and market valuation. Furthermore, firms that prioritize reducing water use and greater efficiency can face lower regulatory risks as local, regional, and national environmental laws place increasing emphasis on resource conservation.

## Metrics

# Product Lifecycle Management

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) & Original Design Manufacturing (ODM) industry, along with the industry's customers such as hardware companies, face increasing challenges associated with environmental externalities attributed to product manufacturing, transport, use, and disposal. Rapid obsolescence of hardware products exacerbates such externalities. The industry's products commonly contain hazardous materials, making safe end-of-life disposal a critical aspect to manage. Companies unable to minimize the environmental externalities of their products may face increased regulatory costs as local, regional, and national environmental laws place increasing emphasis on resource conservation and waste management. Through product innovation that facilitates end-of-life product recovery and the use of less-impactful materials, EMS & ODM manufacturers can achieve improvements in lifecycle impacts, reduce regulatory risk, and realize cost savings.

# Industry Description

Commercial banks accept deposits and make loans to individuals and corporations as well as engage in lending for infrastructure, real estate, and other projects. By providing these services, the industry serves an essential role in the functioning of global economies and in facilitating the transfer of financial resources to their most productive capacity. The industry is driven by the volume of deposits, quality of loans made, the economic environment, and interest rates. It is further characterized by risk from mismatched assets and liabilities. The regulatory environment that governs the commercial banking industry saw significant changes in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and continues to evolve today. These and other regulatory trends have the potential to impact shareholder value and sustainability performance. Commercial banks with global operations must manage new regulations in multiple jurisdictions that are creating regulatory uncertainty, particularly around consistent application of new rules.

Note: The SASB Commercial Banks (FN-CB) Standard addresses ""pure play"" commercial banking services, which the SASB recognizes may not include all the activities of integrated financial institutions, such as investment banking and brokerage services, mortgage finance, consumer finance, asset management and custody services, and insurance. Separate SASB accounting standards are available that address the sustainability issues for activities in those industries.

# Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Credit Analysis

## Topic Summary

As financial intermediaries, commercial banks contribute to significant positive and negative environmental and social externalities through their lending practices. Therefore, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors can have material implications for the underlying companies, assets, and projects that commercial banks lend to across a range of industries. It is therefore increasingly necessary for companies to examine ESG factors when determining the quality of collateral. Commercial banks also have the potential to enable positive environmental and social externalities and to generate significant revenue streams through their lending practices. Commercial banks that fail to address these risks and opportunities could face diminished returns and reduced value for shareholders. Commercial banks should subsequently disclose how ESG factors are integrated into lending processes and the current level of portfolio risk associated with specific sustainability trends. In particular, investor and regulatory pressure is mounting for banks to disclose how they address climate change related risks.

# Transition Risk Exposure

## Topic Summary

Commercial banks' loans to and investments in carbon-related industries are becoming inherently and increasingly risky due to evolving regulation and rapid technological change related to the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient global economy. Heightened risk may emerge for entities in carbon-related industries from the premature write-downs, or potential 'stranding,' of long-lived assets. Borrowers or investees may also face further financial pressure from increased costs of operations and compliance due to climate-related risks. Calculating and disclosing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of counterparties and investees attributed to the loans and investments made by a commercial bank—i.e., the bank's 'financed emissions'—can therefore help users of the general purpose financial reporting of commercial banks better understand their exposure to such risks. Commercial banks that fail to manage these transition risks and associated opportunities through their lending and investing could face diminished returns and reduced value for investors.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

The production of construction materials, particularly cement, generates significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from on-site fuel combustion and chemical processes. The industry has achieved gains in efficiency for reducing emissions per ton of materials produced. At the same time, increasing production is associated with an increase in absolute emissions from cement production. The production of construction materials remains carbon-intensive relative to other industries, exposing the industry to higher operating and capital expenditures from emissions regulations. Strategies to reduce GHG emissions include: energy efficiency, use of alternative and renewable fuels, carbon sequestration, and clinker substitution. Operational efficiencies can be achieved through the cost-effective reduction of GHG emissions. Such efficiencies can mitigate the potential financial impact of increased fuel costs as well as direct emissions from regulations that seek to limit—or put a price on—GHG emissions.

## Metrics

# Air Quality

## Topic Summary

On-site fuel combustion and production processes in the Construction Materials industry emit criteria air pollutants and hazardous chemicals, including small quantities of organic compounds and heavy metals. Emissions of particular concern include nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, heavy metals (e.g., mercury), dioxins, and volatile organic compounds, among others. These air emissions can have significant, localized human health and environmental impacts. Financial impacts resulting from air emissions will vary depending on the specific location of operations and the applicable air emissions regulations, but could include higher operating or capital expenditures and regulatory or legal penalties. Active management of the issue—through technological and process improvements—could allow companies to limit the impact of regulations and benefit from operational efficiencies that could lead to a lower cost structure over time.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

The production of construction materials requires a significant quantity of energy, sourced primarily from direct combustion of fossil fuels as well as from purchased electricity. Energy-intense production has implications for climate change, and electricity purchases from the grid can create indirect Scope 2 emissions. Construction materials companies also use alternative fuels for their kilns, such as scrap tires and waste oil—often waste generated by other industries. If properly managed, these can lower energy costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, there could be potentially negative impacts, such as releases of harmful air pollutants that companies need to minimize in order to obtain net benefits from using such fuels. Decisions about use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site generation of electricity (versus purchases from the grid) can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of energy supply. Affordable, easily accessible, and reliable energy is an important competitive factor in this industry, with purchased fuels and electricity accounting for a significant proportion of total production costs. The way in which a construction materials company manages its overall energy efficiency, its reliance on different types of energy and associated sustainability risks, and its ability to access alternative sources of energy can influence its profitability.

## Metrics

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

The production of construction materials requires substantial volumes of water for the production process. Companies face operational, regulatory, and reputational risks due to water scarcity, costs of water acquisition, regulations on effluents or amount of water used, and competition with local communities and other industries for limited water resources. Risks are likely to be higher in regions of water scarcity, due to potential water availability constraints and price volatility. Companies that are unable to secure a stable water supply could face production disruptions, while rising water prices could directly increase production costs. Consequently, the adoption of technologies and processes that reduce water consumption could lower operating risks and costs for companies by minimizing the impact of regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions on company operations.

## Metrics

EM-CM-140a.1. (1) Total fresh water withdrawn, (2) percentage recycled, (3) percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

#### Page 65

# Waste Management

## Topic Summary

Recycling rates in construction materials production are high. However, wastes from production processes, pollution control devices, and from hazardous waste management activities present a regulatory risk and can raise operating costs. Cement kiln dust (CKD) —consisting of fine-grained, solid, highly alkaline waste removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices—is the most significant waste category in the industry. Regulatory risk remains from evolving environmental laws, including those at local and national levels and for other waste streams. Companies that reduce waste streams—hazardous waste streams in particular—and recycle by-products, can therefore lower regulatory and litigation risks and costs.

## Metrics

EM-CM-150a.1. Amount of waste generated, percentage hazardous, percentage recycled

1 The entity shall disclose the amount of waste generated in metric tons.

1.1 Waste is defined as anything for which the entity has no further use and which is discarded or is released to the environment.

1.2 The scope includes slags, dusts, sludges, used oil, and other solid wastes that meet the above definition.

1.3 The scope excludes gaseous wastes.

2 The entity shall disclose the percentage of waste generated that was hazardous.

2.1 The percentage of hazardous waste shall be calculated as the weight of hazardous waste as defined per the legal or regulatory framework(s) applicable within the jurisdiction(s) where the waste is generated divided by the total weight of waste material.

2.2 Hazardous waste generally includes those that display the following characteristics: ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity.

2.3 The entity may use Subtitle C of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) or the EU Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, including its subsequent amendments) for the purposes of defining hazardous waste for operations located in jurisdictions that lack applicable legal or regulatory definitions.

2.4 The entity shall disclose the applicable jurisdictional standard or regulation used to define hazardous waste.

3 The entity shall disclose the percentage of waste generated that was recycled.

#### Page 66

3.1 The percentage recycled shall be calculated as the weight of waste material that was reused, plus the weight recycled or remanufactured (through treatment or processing) by the entity, plus the amount sent externally for further recycling, divided by the total weight of waste material, where:

3.1.1 Reused materials are defined as those recovered products or components of products that are used for the same purpose for which they were conceived.

3.1.2 Recycled and remanufactured materials are defined as waste materials that have been reprocessed or treated by means of production or manufacturing processes and made into a final product or made into a component for incorporation into a product.

3.1.3 The scope of recycled and remanufactured products include primary recycled materials, co-products (outputs of equal value to primary recycled materials), and by-products (outputs of lesser value to primary recycled materials).

3.1.4 Portions of products and materials that are disposed of in landfills are not considered recycled; only the portions of products that are directly incorporated into new products, co-products, or by-products shall be included in the percentage recycled.

3.1.5 Materials sent for further recycling include those materials which are transferred to a third party for the expressed purpose of reuse, recycling, or refurbishment.

# Product Innovation

## Topic Summary

Innovations in building materials are a key component in the growth of sustainable construction. Consumer and regulatory trends are largely driving adoption of sustainable building materials and processes that are more resource efficient and can reduce health impacts of buildings throughout their lifecycle. This is creating new business drivers for construction materials companies, with an opportunity to increase revenues. Furthermore, some new products require less energy to produce, or use largely recycled inputs, reducing production costs. Sustainable construction materials, therefore, can contribute to a company's long-term growth and competitiveness.

# Industry Description

The Airlines industry is comprised of companies that provide air transportation globally to passengers for both leisure and business purposes. This includes commercial full-service, low-cost, and regional airlines. Full-service carriers typically use a hub-and-spoke model to design their routes within countries and internationally. Low-cost carriers usually offer a smaller number of routes as well as no-frills service to their customers. Regional carriers typically operate under contract to full-service carriers, expanding the network of the larger carriers. Many airline companies also have a cargo segment in their operations from which they generate additional revenue. It is common within the industry for companies to form partnerships or join alliances in order to increase network size. Operating as an alliance allows airlines to offer customers access to international or otherwise underserved itineraries on multiple airlines under one ticket. At the same time, airlines share some overhead costs and increase their competitive position in the global market without having to operate outside their home country.

---

112 Note to TR-AL-000.A – Available seat kilometers (ASK) is defined as the maximum potential cumulative kilometers traveled by passengers (i.e., kilometers traveled by occupied and unoccupied seats).

113 Note to TR-AL-000.B – Load factor is a measure of capacity utilization and is calculated as passenger kilometers traveled divided by available seat kilometers.

114 Note to TR-AL-000.C – Revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) is defined as the cumulative total kilometers traveled by revenue passengers. A revenue passenger is passenger for whose transportation an air carrier receives commercial remuneration.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

As a result of its heavy reliance on hydrocarbon fuels, the Airlines industry generates a significant amount of emissions, over 99 percent of which are in the form of carbon dioxide (CO₂). The industry is thus subject to compliance costs and risks associated with climate change mitigation policies. The main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for airlines companies are aircraft fuel use and emissions, ground equipment, and facility electricity. Aircraft fuel use is the largest contributor to total emissions from the industry, and fuel management is a critical part of reducing emissions. Management of the environmental impacts of fuel usage includes increasing fuel efficiency through fleet upgrades, retrofits, and optimization of flight speed and route design as well as and incorporating alternative and sustainable fuels. These initiatives require capital expenditures, but in the long-run can reduce fuel costs and decrease a company's exposure to the risks of GHG emissions programs and regulations.

# Industry Description

The Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors industry encompasses a variety of retailing categories such as department stores, mass merchants, home products stores, and warehouse clubs, as well as a smaller segment of distributors like electronics wholesalers and automotive wholesalers. Common to these companies (except for the distribution segment) is that they manage global supply chains to anticipate consumer demands, keep costs low, and keep products stocked in their brick-and-mortar storefronts. This is a highly competitive industry, in which each company category generally has a small number of key players, characterized by generally low margins. The relatively substitutable nature of retail makes companies in this industry especially susceptible to reputational risks.

Note: SASB has separate standards for the Food Retailers & Distributors (FB-FR), Drug Retailers (HC-DR), E-Commerce (CG-EC), and Apparel, Accessories & Footwear (CG-AA) industries. Retail companies involved in food or drug retail, e-commerce, or apparel, accessories, and footwear manufacturing should also consider the disclosure topics and metrics outlined in these other standards.

# Energy Management in Retail & Distribution

## Topic Summary

Companies in this industry require significant amounts of energy for their retail facilities and warehouses. Sustainability factors—such as the increasing number of GHG-emissions regulations, incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy—are leading to price increases in conventional electricity sources while making alternative sources more cost-competitive. Fossil fuel-based energy production and consumption contribute to significant environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. Decisions regarding energy sourcing and type, as well as the use of alternative energy, can create trade-offs related to the energy supply's cost and reliability for operations. It is becoming increasingly important for companies to manage their overall energy efficiency, and their access to alternative energy sources. Efficiency in this area can have financial implications through direct cost savings, which are particularly beneficial in this low-margin industry.

# Industry Description

The Insurance industry provides both traditional and nontraditional insurance-related products. Traditional policy lines include property, life, casualty, and reinsurance. Nontraditional products include annuities, alternative risk transfers, and financial guarantees. Companies in the insurance industry also engage in proprietary investments. Insurance companies generally operate within a single segment in the industry, e.g., property and casualty, although there are some large insurance companies with diversified operations. Similarly, companies may vary based on the level of their geographic segmentation. While large companies may underwrite insurance premiums in multiple countries, smaller companies generally operate at a national or even local level. Insurance premiums, underwriting revenue, and investment income drive industry growth, while insurance claim payments present the most significant cost and source of uncertainty for profits. Insurance companies provide products and services that enable the transfer, pooling, and sharing of risk necessary for a well-functioning economy. Insurance companies, through their products, can also create a form of moral hazard, lowering incentives to improve underlying behavior and performance, and thus contributing to sustainability impacts. Similar to other financial institutions, insurance companies face risks associated with credit and financial markets. Within the industry, companies that engage in non-traditional or non-insurance activities, including credit default swaps (CDS) protection and debt securities insurance, have been identified by regulators as being more vulnerable to financial market developments, and subsequently, more likely to amplify or contribute to systemic risk. As a result, insurance companies face the potential of being designated as Systemically Important Financial Institutions, thus exposing them to enhanced regulation and oversight.

Note: Accounting metrics for the material sustainability issues associated with the provision of health insurance are outlined in the SASB Managed Care (HC-MC) Industry Standard.

# Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Investment Management

## Topic Summary

Insurance companies are responsible for investing capital to ensure the preservation of premium revenues equivalent to expected policy claim payouts and must be able to maintain this asset-liability parity over the long term. As environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors have increasingly been shown to have a material impact on the performance of corporations and other assets, there is an increasing need for insurance companies to incorporate these factors into the management of their investments. Failure to address these issues could lead to diminished risk-adjusted returns of their portfolios and limit a company's ability to issue claim payments. Companies should therefore enhance disclosure on how ESG factors, including climate change and natural resource constraints, are incorporated into the investment of policy premiums and affect the portfolio risk.

# Policies Designed to Incentivize Responsible Behavior

## Topic Summary

Advances in technology and the development of new policy products have allowed insurance companies to limit claim payments while encouraging responsible behavior. The industry is subsequently in a unique position to generate positive social and environmental externalities. Insurance companies have the ability to incentivize healthy lifestyles and safe behavior as well as the development of sustainability-related projects and technologies such as those focused on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture. As the renewable energy industry continues to grow, insurance companies may seek related growth opportunities by underwriting insurance in this area. Additionally, such policy clauses that provide incentives through incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors can be used as tools to mitigate risk in the overall underwriting portfolio, which can reduce insurance payouts over the long term. Therefore, disclosure on premiums written related to energy efficiency and low carbon technology as well as discussion of how companies incentivize health, safety, and/or environmentally responsible actions or behaviors would allow investors to assess how insurance companies manage their performance on this topic.

## Metrics

# Physical Risk Exposure

## Topic Summary

Catastrophe losses associated with extreme weather events will continue to have a material, adverse impact on the Insurance industry. The extent of this impact is likely to evolve as climate change increases the frequency and severity of both modeled and non-modeled natural catastrophes, including hurricanes, floods, and droughts. Failure to appropriately understand environmental risks and price them into the underwritten insurance products may result in higher than expected claims on policies. Subsequently, insurance companies that incorporate climate change considerations into their underwriting process for individual contracts as well as the management of firm-level risks and capital adequacy will be better positioned to protect shareholder value. Enhanced disclosure of a company's approach to incorporating these factors, in addition to quantitative data such as the probable maximum loss and total losses attributable to insurance payouts, will provide investors with the information necessary to assess current and future performance on this issue.

# Transition Risk Exposure

## Topic Summary

Insurance companies invest premium revenue to meet insurance claim pay-outs and need to consider asset-liability management. In managing their investments, insurance entities increasingly need to consider climate-related risks and opportunities, such as those associated with technological innovations and increasing pressure to comply with emerging policy and regulation. Failure to manage these issues could lead to diminished risk-adjusted returns on investment portfolios and limit an entity's ability to meet insurance claims. Measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with investments—a concept commonly referred to as 'financed emissions'—can enhance understanding of exposure to such risks and opportunities and associated transition planning.

# Sustainability Services

## Topic Summary

In the Real Estate Services industry, buildings owned or occupied by clients generally have significant sustainability impacts. Buildings, and the activities that take place within them, drive energy consumption, direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption, waste generation, and indoor environmental quality concerns that can impact the health of occupants. Companies in the industry have an opportunity to improve the sustainability impacts of buildings and their operations through sustainability-related services. These services may include utility data management, energy procurement, energy and water benchmarking, resource efficiency improvements, activities related to sustainability certifications, and sustainability consulting and training. Companies in the industry can further impact building sustainability by arranging leases that incentivize both owners and tenants to enhance sustainability performance, while yielding financial benefits for both parties. Providing these services can drive new revenue growth and increase client retention; effective sustainability services can benefit owners and/or tenants through improved asset values, increased tenant demand, decreased operating costs, and improved tenant experiences.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

The Processed Foods industry is highly reliant on energy and fuel as primary inputs for value creation in manufacturing food products. Energy is needed to operate large manufacturing facilities for cooking, refrigeration, and packaging. Energy production and consumption contributes to significant environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution, which have the potential to indirectly, yet materially, impact the results of operations of processed foods companies. Energy efficiency in production and distribution can mitigate exposure to volatile energy costs and limit a company's contribution to direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Producers may be able to further reduce the risk posed by volatile fossil fuel energy costs—particularly natural gas, which is used heavily in the industry—by diversifying their energy portfolio across a range of sources. Decisions regarding the use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site generation of electricity versus purchasing from the grid, can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of the energy supply.

## Metrics

2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.

2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

#### Page 260

3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3.3 The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity.

3.3.1 For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.2 For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.3 The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of renewable energy.

3.4 For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from biomass sources is limited to:

3.4.2 Energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state renewable portfolio standard.

4 The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data including electricity from solar or wind energy).

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Processed Foods companies rely on a large water supply for cooking, processing, and cleaning finished goods. Additionally, companies in the industry generate and must manage its wastewater discharge from processing activities. As water scarcity becomes an issue of increasing importance, processed foods companies—especially those operating in water-stressed regions—may face increasing operational risks. Companies in the industry may face higher operational costs as well as water shortages due to physical availability and/or regulations. Companies can manage water-related risks and opportunities through capital investments and assessment of facility locations relative to water scarcity risks, improvements to operational efficiency, and partnerships with regulators and communities on issues related to water access and effluent.

# Environmental & Social Impacts of Ingredient Supply Chain

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Processed Foods industry manage global supply chains to source a wide range of ingredient inputs. How companies screen, monitor, and engage with suppliers on environmental and social topics affects the ability of companies to maintain a steady supply and manage price fluctuations. Supply chain management issues related to labor and environmental practices, ethics, or corruption may also result in regulatory fines and/or increased long-term operational costs for companies. The consumer-facing nature of the industry increases the reputational risks associated with supplier performance. Companies can engage with key suppliers to manage environmental and social risks to improve supply chain resiliency, mitigate reputational risks, and potentially increase consumer demand or capture new market opportunities.

# Ingredient Sourcing

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Processed Foods industry source a wide range of ingredients, largely agricultural inputs, from global suppliers. The industry's ability to source ingredients and at certain price points fluctuates with supply availability, which may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management, and other resource scarcity considerations. This exposure can lead to price volatility which may affect company profitability. Climate change, water scarcity, and land-use restrictions present risks to a company's long-term ability to source key materials and ingredients. Companies that source ingredients which are more productive and less resource-intensive, or work closely with suppliers to increase their adaptability to climate change and other resource scarcity risks will be better protected from price volatility and/or supply disruptions.

# Hardware Infrastructure Energy & Water Management

## Topic Summary

A large part of the energy consumed by the E-Commerce industry is used to power critical hardware and IT infrastructure in data centers. Data centers need to be powered continuously, and disruptions to the energy supply can have a material impact on operations, depending on the magnitude and timing of the disruption. Companies also face a tradeoff when it comes to energy and water consumption for their data center cooling needs: Cooling data centers with water instead of chillers is a means of improving energy efficiency, but it can lead to dependence on significant local water resources. Companies that effectively manage this issue may benefit from cost savings and minimize reputational risks, as there is growing concern over energy and water use.

# Product Packaging & Distribution

## Topic Summary

A significant part of the E-Commerce industry's added value comes from firms' ability to move a wide array of goods efficiently to consumers who would otherwise have to personally travel to collect the goods from brick-and-mortar stores. As the volume of packaging shipments increases, the industry may become more exposed to environmental externalities, such as carbon pricing and subsequent rising fuel costs that present risks associated with the shipping of products. While firms that outsource shipping and logistics have less control over the specific processes of shipping operations, they can still select suppliers with more energy-efficient business practices. As this is a highly competitive and low-margin industry, the ability to shave off shipping costs through fuel reduction and more efficient routing can allow firms to pass those savings on to their customers. Additionally, e-commerce firms have an incentive to minimize the use of packaging. Efficient packaging can lead to cost savings from reducing the amount of material that needs to be purchased, as well as saving on logistics costs, as more products can fit into a single shipping load.

# Industry Description

The Electric Utilities & Power Generators industry is made up of companies that generate electricity; build, own, and operate transmission and distribution (T&D) lines; and sell electricity. Utilities generate electricity from a number of different sources, commonly including coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, hydropower, solar, wind, and other renewable and fossil fuel energy sources. The industry comprises companies operating in both regulated and unregulated business structures. Regulated utilities maintain a business model in which they accept comprehensive oversight from regulators on their pricing mechanisms and their allowed return on equity, among other types of regulation, in exchange for their license to operate as a monopoly. Unregulated companies, or merchant power companies, are often independent power producers (IPPs) that generate electricity to sell to the wholesale market, which includes regulated utility buyers and other end-users. Furthermore, the industry is divided across regulated and deregulated power markets—referring to how far up the value chain regulated utility operations span. Regulated markets typically contain vertically integrated utilities that own and operate everything from the generation of power to its retail distribution. Deregulated markets commonly split generation from distribution, designed to encourage competition at the wholesale power level. Overall, companies in the industry are challenged with the complex mission of providing reliable, accessible, low-cost power while balancing the protection of human life and the environment.

Note: The SASB Electric Utilities & Power Generators Industry covers activities related only to electricity provision, not to natural gas provision. Some utilities may operate in both electricity and natural gas markets. Utilities undertaking activities related to natural gas sourcing and distribution should also consider the separate Gas Utilities & Distributors Industry Standard (IF-GU).

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions & Energy Resource Planning

## Topic Summary

Electricity generation represents the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the world. These emissions, mainly carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, are mostly by-products of fossil fuels combustion. The transmission and/or distribution (T&D) segments of the industry are responsible for a negligible amount of its emissions. Electric utility companies could face significant operating and capital expenditures for mitigating GHG emissions as environmental regulations become increasingly stringent. While many of these costs can be passed on to a utility's customers, some power generators, especially in deregulated markets, may not be able to recoup these costs. Companies can reduce GHG emissions from electricity generation mainly through careful planning of their infrastructure investments to ensure an energy mix capable of meeting the emissions requirements set forth by regulations and by implementing industry-leading technologies and processes. Being proactive in cost-effectively reducing GHG emissions can create a competitive advantage for companies and mitigate unanticipated regulatory compliance costs. Failure to properly estimate capital-expenditure needs and permitting costs, or other difficulties in reducing GHG emissions, could result in significant negative impacts on returns in the future in the form of asset write-downs, costs of obtaining carbon credits, or unexpected increases in operating and capital expenditures. Regulatory emphasis on this issue will likely increase in the coming decades, as exemplified by the international emissions-reduction agreement made at the 21st session of the United Nations Conference of the Parties that took place in late 2015.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Electricity generation is one of the most water-intensive industries in the world in terms of water withdrawals. Thermoelectric power plants—typically coal, nuclear, and natural gas—are dependent on large quantities of water for cooling purposes. The industry is facing increasing water-related supply and regulatory risks, potentially requiring capital investment in technology or even resulting in stranded assets. As water supplies tighten in many regions—and electricity generation, agriculture, and community use compete for water supplies in the coming decade—power plants may increasingly be unable to operate at their full capacity, or at all, because of region-specific water constraints. The availability of water is a key factor to consider when calculating the future value of many electricity-generating assets and for evaluating existing proposals for new generation sources. Heightened water scarcity—due to factors such as increasing consumption and reduced supplies as a result of climate change, which could result in more frequent or intense droughts—could prompt regulatory authorities to limit companies' ability to withdraw necessary amounts of water, especially in regions with high baseline water stress. Furthermore, companies must contend with the growing regulations related to the significant biodiversity impacts that such large withdrawals can cause. To mitigate risks, companies can both invest in more efficient water-usage systems for existing plants and place strategic priority on assessing long-term water availability, as well as water-related biodiversity risks, when siting new power plants.

# End-Use Efficiency & Demand

## Topic Summary

Energy efficiency is a low-lifecycle-cost method to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as less electricity needs to be generated to provide the same end-use energy services. Utilities can partake in a wide range of activities to promote energy efficiency and conservation among their customers. Such strategies include offering rebates for energy-efficient appliances, weatherizing customers' homes, educating customers on energy-saving methods, offering incentives to customers to curb electricity use during times of peak demand (""demand response""), and investing in technology such as smart meters, which allows customers to track their energy usage—among many other strategies. These efforts, which save consumers money, can also manifest in lowered operating costs for electric utilities because they can reduce peak demand. Furthermore, depending on the sentiment of the utilities commission in a company's region, energy efficiency can be a regulatory priority before new builds are considered. How an electric utility stands to gain or lose from this trend toward GHG mitigation is significantly predicated on its regulatory environment. Traditional rate structures generally do not give electric utilities an incentive for energy efficiency, and further, they may economically suffer from reductions in customer demand. This is increasingly driving electric utilities, and their regulators and customers, to pursue alternative ratemaking. Such alternative rate design often ""decouples"" utility revenues from customer consumption, and may also build in explicit incentives for end-use efficiency and demand reductions. Overall, companies whose strategic plan strives to reduce their downside risks from demand fluctuations, gain adequate and timely returns on needed efficiency investments. Further, lowering costs through efficiency initiatives help position utility companies to earn stronger risk-adjusted returns over the long term.

## Metrics

### IF-EU-420a.2. Percentage of electric load served by smart grid technology

1    The entity shall disclose the percentage of its electric load, in megawatt hours, served by smart grid technology.

# Nuclear Safety & Emergency Management

## Topic Summary

Nuclear incidents, while exceedingly rare, can have significant human health and environmental consequences as nuclear accidents can be severe if they do occur. While owners of nuclear power plants in many regions have operated for decades without any major public safety incidents, the occurrence of infrequent but high-magnitude incidents anywhere in the world can have major impacts on the entire nuclear power industry. Companies that own and operate nuclear plants could face a loss of their license to operate, either entirely or in the operation of nuclear plants, as well as many other financial consequences in the event of an accident—though companies carry insurance and may have legal protections from certain liabilities. Failure to comply with the safety regulations can be extremely expensive to nuclear power operators; in extreme circumstances it can make the continued operation of the plant uneconomical. As a result of significant financial repercussions, both from ongoing safety compliance as well as the materialization of tail risk incidents, companies that own or operate nuclear plants need to be vigilant in the safety compliance, best practices, and upgrades of their facilities. They also need to maintain robust emergency preparedness training for their staff and a strong safety culture. These measures can reduce the probability that accidents will occur and enable a company to effectively detect and respond to such incidents.

# Grid Resiliency

## Topic Summary

Electricity is critical for the continued function of most elements of modern life, from medicine to finance, creating a societal reliance on continuous service. There are potentially high societal costs from major disruptions to electricity infrastructure. Disruptions can be caused by extreme weather events, natural disasters, and cyber attacks. As the frequency and severity of extreme weather events associated with climate change continues to increase, all segments of electric utilities companies—and especially major transmission and distribution (T&D) operations—will face increasing physical threats to their infrastructure. This could result in frequent or significant service disruptions, outages, and the need to upgrade or repair damaged or compromised equipment, all of which may result in substantial costs and damaged perspectives of regulators and customers. The increased usage of smart grid technology has several benefits, including strengthening the resiliency of the grid to extreme weather events. However, this technology can make the grid more vulnerable to cyber attacks, as it provides hackers more entryways into infrastructure systems. Companies need to implement strategies that minimize the probability and magnitude of impacts from extreme weather events and cyber attacks. They can remain competitive in the face of increasing external competition by actively submitting compelling rate cases to improve the reliability, resilience, and quality of their infrastructure.

# Materials Efficiency

## Topic Summary

The Wind Technology & Project Developers industry's long-term success depends on its ability to produce energy at a comparatively lower cost than other energy sources. Steel and other materials purchases are one of the largest cost components of turbines and inputs such as steel have exhibited price volatility in the past. In recent years, wind turbines have grown in size, in terms of both the tower height and the swept area of the rotor, to improve energy output and increase the potential for wind energy production in more areas. To achieve this expansion cost-effectively, companies can employ innovative methods to increase turbine output while using materials more efficiently. This could influence companies' competitiveness and market share, costs of production, and operational risks related to the supply and price volatility of raw materials, as well as the ability of the industry to scale.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Mining operations are energy-intensive and generate significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including carbon dioxide from fuel use during mining, ore processing, and smelting activities. The extent and type of GHG emissions can vary depending on the metal mined and processed. Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG emissions in response to the risks posed by climate change may result in additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for metals and mining companies due to climate change mitigation policies. Operational efficiencies can be achieved through the cost-effective reduction of GHG emissions. Such efficiencies can mitigate the potential financial impact of increased fuel costs from regulations that seek to limit—or put a price on—GHG emissions.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Mining and metals production is often energy-intensive, with a significant proportion of energy consumption in the industry accounted for by purchased electricity. While fuel combustion on-site contributes to the industry's direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions, electricity purchases from the grid can result in indirect, Scope 2 emissions. The energy intensity of operations may increase with decreasing grades of deposits and increasing depth and scale of mining operations. The choice between on-site versus grid-sourced electricity, and use of alternative energy, can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of energy supply. Affordable and easily accessible energy is an important competitive factor in a commodity market driven by global competition, and purchased fuels and electricity can account for a significant proportion of total production costs. The way in which a company manages its overall energy efficiency and intensity, its reliance on different types of energy, and its ability to access alternative sources of energy, can therefore be a material factor.

## Metrics

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Mining and metals production can impact both the availability and the quality of local water resources. Metals and mining companies face operational, regulatory, and reputational risks due to water scarcity, costs of water acquisition, regulations on effluents or amount of water used, and competition with local communities and other industries for limited water resources. Impacts associated with water management may include higher costs, liabilities, and lost revenues due to curtailment or suspension of operations. The severity of these risks can vary depending on the region's water availability and the regulatory environment. Companies in the industry may deploy new technologies to manage risks related to water risk, including desalination, water recirculation, and innovative waste-disposal solutions. Reducing water use and contamination can create operational efficiencies for companies and lower their operating costs.

# Industry Description

The Investment Banking & Brokerage industry consists of firms performing a wide range of functions in the capital markets, including assisting with the capital-raising and allocation process, and providing market-making and advisory services for corporations, financial institutions, governments, and high net-worth individuals. Specific activities include financial advisory and securities underwriting services conducted on a fee basis; securities and commodities brokerage activities, which involves buying and selling securities or commodities contracts and options on a commission or fee basis for investors; and trading and principal investment activities, which involves the buying and selling of equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities, and other securities for client-driven and proprietary trading. Investment banks also originate and securitize loans for infrastructure and other projects. Companies in the industry generate their revenues from global markets and, therefore, are exposed to various regulatory environments. The industry continues to face regulatory pressure to reform and disclose aspects of operations that present systemic risks. Specifically, firms are facing new capital requirements, stress testing, limits on proprietary trading, and increased scrutiny on compensation practices.

Note: The SASB Investment Banking & Brokerage (FN-IB) Standard addresses ""pure play"" investment banking and brokerage services, which the SASB recognizes may not include all the activities of integrated financial institutions, such as mortgage finance, commercial banking, consumer finance, asset management and custody services, and insurance. Separate SASB accounting standards are available that address the sustainability issues for activities in those industries.

# Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Investment Banking & Brokerage Activities

## Topic Summary

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors can have material implications for the companies, assets, and projects that investment banks provide services to or invest in across a range of industries. Therefore, by taking these factors into account in their underwriting, advisory, and investing and lending activities, investment banks can address significant positive and negative environmental and social externalities. The potential for both value creation and loss associated with ESG factors suggests that investment banking and brokerage firms have a responsibility to their shareholders and clients to incorporate consideration of these factors into analysis and valuation related to all core products, including sell-side research, advisory services, origination, underwriting, and principal transactions. Investment banking and brokerage companies that fail to address these risks and opportunities could expose themselves to increased reputational and financial risks. On the other hand, appropriately pricing ESG risks could reduce investment banks' financial risk exposure, help generate additional revenue, and/or open new market opportunities. To help investors understand how well companies in the industry manage performance around this issue, investment banks should disclose how ESG factors are incorporated into their core products and services.

# Transition Risk Exposure

## Topic Summary

Risks and opportunities relating to the transition to a lower-carbon economy can have significant implications for the entities, assets, and projects that investment banks service either through the provision of finance and/or other capital markets activities and financial advisory services. With respect to the latter, policy change, technological innovation and shifting market dynamics, can give rise to transition risks including reputational damage which could ultimately impact the bank's enterprise value. Alternatively, the transition to a lower-carbon economy could open new market opportunities leading to increased revenue. Measuring and disclosing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the provision of core products and services such as underwriting, advisory and securitisation activities—a concept known as 'facilitated emissions'—can provide useful information to enable users of general purpose financial reporting to assess implications for the revenue generated by the entity's capital markets activities.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

The Containers & Packaging industry generates direct (Scope 1) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in manufacturing and cogeneration processes. GHG emissions can create regulatory compliance costs or penalties and operating risks for companies in the industry. However, resulting financial impacts will vary depending on the magnitude of emissions and the prevailing emissions regulations. The industry may be subject to increasingly stringent regulations as nations seek to limit or reduce emissions. Companies that cost-effectively manage GHG emissions through greater energy efficiency, the use of alternative fuels, or manufacturing process advances could benefit from improved operating efficiency and reduced regulatory risk, among other financial benefits.

## Metrics

RT-CP-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations

1 The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol—carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).

1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).

1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.

2 Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).

2.1 Acceptable calculation methodologies include those that conform to the GHG Protocol as the base reference, but provide additional guidance, such as industry- or region-specific guidance. Examples include, but are not limited to:

3 The entity shall disclose the percentage of its gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions that are covered under an emissions-limiting regulation or program that is intended to directly limit or reduce emissions, such as cap-and-trade schemes, carbon tax/fee systems, and other emissions control (e.g., command-and-control approach) and permit-based mechanisms.

3.1 Examples of emissions-limiting regulations include, but are not limited to:

3.1.1 California Cap-and-Trade (California Global Warming Solutions Act)

3.1.2 European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)

3.1.3 Quebec Cap-and-Trade (Draft Bill 42 of 2009)

3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as the total amount of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions (CO2-e) that are covered under emissions-limiting regulations divided by the total amount of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions (CO2-e).

3.2.1 For emissions that are subject to multiple emissions-limiting regulations, the entity shall not account for those emissions more than once.

3.3 The scope of emissions-limiting regulations excludes emissions covered under voluntary emissions-limiting regulations (e.g., voluntary trading systems), as well as reporting-based regulations.

4 The entity may discuss any change in its emissions from the previous reporting period, including whether the change was due to emissions reductions, divestment, acquisition, mergers, changes in output, and/or changes in calculation methodology.

#### Page 510

The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and energy management strategies depend on the type of products manufactured. Typically, fossil fuels such as natural gas and biomass are the predominant form of energy used, while purchased electricity may also represent a significant share. Therefore, energy purchases can represent a significant share of production costs. A company's energy mix may include energy generated onsite, purchased grid electricity and fossil fuels, and renewable and alternative energy. Trade-offs in the use of such energy sources include cost, reliability of supply, related water use and air emissions, and regulatory compliance and risk. As such, a company's energy intensity and energy sourcing decisions can affect its operating efficiency and risk profile over time.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Containers and packaging manufacturing requires water for various stages of production, including in raw-materials processing, process cooling, and steam generation at onsite cogeneration plants. Long-term historic increases in water scarcity and cost, and expectations of continued increases—due to overconsumption and constrained supplies, resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution, and climate change—indicate the heightened importance of water management. Water scarcity can result in a higher risk of operational disruption for companies with water-intensive operations and can also increase water procurement costs and capital expenditures. Meanwhile, containers and packaging manufacturing can generate process wastewater that must be treated before disposal. Non-compliance with water quality regulations may result in regulatory compliance and mitigation costs or legal expenses stemming from litigation. Reducing water use and consumption through increased efficiency and other water management strategies can lead to lower operating costs over time and can mitigate financial impacts of regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions of operations.

# Waste Management

## Topic Summary

Containers and packaging manufacturing may generate hazardous process waste, including, but not limited to, heavy metals, spent acids, catalysts, and wastewater treatment sludge. Companies face regulatory and operational challenges in managing waste, as some wastes are subject to regulations pertaining to its transport, treatment, storage, and disposal. Waste management strategies include reduced generation, effective treatment and disposal, and recycling and recovery, where possible. Such activities, while requiring initial investment or operating costs, can lower companies' long-term cost structure and mitigate the risk of remediation liabilities or regulatory penalties.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Water Utilities & Services industry require significant energy inputs for the withdrawal, conveyance, treatment, and distribution or discharge of potable water and wastewater. Utility operating costs are directly related to energy use, which is typically a company's largest operating cost after purchased water, chemicals, and labor. Purchased grid electricity is the most common energy input. In more remote locations, on-site generation is used to power equipment. The inefficient use of purchased grid electricity creates environmental externalities, such as Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Regulations that address environmental concerns are likely to affect the future grid energy mix, leading to increases in prices. Additionally, climate change is also expected to impact grid reliability, and affect the availability of water resources. As a result, the energy intensity of water utilities is likely to increase in the future as water sources become more difficult to access. Alternative water treatment, such as recycling and desalination, can also require more energy. Together with decisions about the use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site electricity generation, energy efficiency can play an important role in influencing both the cost and the reliability of the energy supply.

# Distribution Network Efficiency

## Topic Summary

Water utilities develop, maintain, and operate complex interconnected infrastructure networks that include extensive pipelines, canals, reservoirs, and pump stations. Significant volumes of water are lost in the distribution network (called ""non-revenue water,"" as it is a distributed volume of water that is not reflected in customer billings). This water is lost primarily because of infrastructure failures and inefficiencies, such as leaking pipes and service connections. Non-revenue real water losses may negatively impact financial performance, raise customer rates, and squander water and other resources such as energy and treatment chemicals. Conversely, improvements to infrastructure and operating processes can limit non-revenue losses, positively impacting revenues and possibly reducing costs. Efficiently directing operational and maintenance expenses or capital expenditures to distribution systems—primarily pipeline and service connection repair, refurbishment, or replacement—can improve company value and provide strong investment returns.

Water efficiency and conservation at the consumer level, whether a product of government mandates, environmental consciousness, or demographic trends, is increasingly important for long-term resource availability and the financial performance of the water supply segment of the industry. The end-use efficiency topic addresses how utilities work with regulators to mitigate revenue declines in the context of the increasing need for resource efficiency. Water efficiency mechanisms, including rate decoupling, can ensure that a utility's revenue can adequately cover its fixed costs and provide the desired levels of returns regardless of sales volume, while simultaneously incentivizing customers to conserve water. Efficiency mechanisms can better align utilities' economic incentives with environmental and social interests, including resource efficiency, lower rates, and increased capital investments in infrastructure. Water utilities are able to manage their exposure to the impact of rate mechanisms through positive regulatory relations, forward-looking rate cases that incorporate efficiency, and a strong execution of efficiency strategy.

## Metrics

IF-WU-420a.1. Percentage of water utility revenues from rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience

1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of water utility revenues from rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience.

1.1 The scope of rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience is limited to rate structures that are explicitly and intentionally designed to:

1.1.1 Financially incentivize customers to reduce water consumption and/or improve water efficiency; and

1.1.2 Improve the revenue resilience of the water utility, primarily in circumstances of declining average customer water use and/or improving average customer water efficiency.

1.2 The scope of rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience includes, but is not limited to, revenue decoupled rate structures.

1.2.1 Revenue decoupled rate structures are defined as a rate adjustment mechanism that separates the utility's fixed cost recovery from the volume sold—and the utility's revenues are collected based on the regulatory determined revenue requirement.

1.2.2 Revenue decoupled rate structures may also be referred to as, ""revenue regulation"" or ""revenue cap regulation,"" where the regulator establishes an allowed revenue requirement and adjusts collections so as to achieve that allowed, or 'target,' revenue irrespective of actual sales.

#### Page 415

1.2.3 Additional guidance on the scope of revenue decoupled rate structures is contained in Alternative Regulation and Ratemaking Approaches for Water Companies, The Brattle Group, September 23, 2013.

1.3 The scope of rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience includes, but is not limited to, rate structures that contain a lost revenue adjustment mechanism (LRAM).

1.3.1 Rate structures that contain an LRAM are defined as volumetric rates that contain a mechanism which allows the entity to recover revenues lost directly resulting from water conservation, water efficiency, and/or demand side management programs that are directly managed and/or implemented by the entity.

1.3.2 Additional guidance on the scope of revenue decoupled rate structures is contained in Alternative Regulation and Ratemaking Approaches for Water Companies, The Brattle Group, September 23, 2013.

1.3.3 The scope of LRAM includes mechanisms that allow the estimation of lost revenues based on the programs' actual impacts, but excludes lost revenues from planned or forecasted programs impacts (as described in Alternative Regulation and Ratemaking Approaches for Water Companies, The Brattle Group, September 23, 2013).

1.4 The scope of rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience excludes straight fixed-variable rate design, absent other rate mechanisms that are explicitly designed to promote conservation.

# Water Supply Resilience

## Topic Summary

Water supply systems obtain water from groundwater and surface water sources. Water supplies may either be accessed directly or purchased from a third party, often a government entity. Water scarcity, water source contamination, infrastructure failures, regulatory restrictions, competing users, and overconsumption by customers are all factors that can jeopardize access to sufficient water supplies. These issues, combined with an increasing risk of extreme and frequent drought conditions due to climate change, may lead to inadequate supplies or mandated water restrictions. The related financial impacts may manifest in different ways, depending on rate structure, but are most likely to impact company value through decreased revenue. Water supply challenges may also lead to increases in the price of purchased water, which could result in higher operating costs. Failures of critical infrastructure such as aqueducts and canals, which could result from events such as earthquakes, are capable of presenting catastrophic risks to customers of the water supply system and could inflict untold financial consequences. Companies are able to mitigate water supply risks (and the resulting financial risks) through diversification of water supplies, sustainable withdrawal levels, technological and infrastructure improvements, contingency planning, positive relations with regulators and other major users, as well as rate structures.

# Network Resiliency & Impacts of Climate Change

## Topic Summary

Climate change is likely to create business uncertainty for water supply systems and wastewater systems due to potential impacts on infrastructure and operations. Climate change can lead to increased water stress, more frequent severe weather events, reduced water quality, and rising sea levels that could impair utility assets or the ability to operate. Water supply and wastewater disposal are basic services for which maintaining continuity is of utmost importance. The increasing frequency and severity of storms challenge water and wastewater treatment facilities, and can affect continuity of service. Intense precipitation may lead to sewage volumes that exceed the capacity of treatment facilities, resulting in the release of untreated effluent. Minimizing current and future risks of service disruptions and inadequate service quality can require additional capital expenditures and operational expenses. As climate change leads to a greater likelihood of extreme weather events, companies that address these risks through redundancies and strategic planning will be better able to serve customers and protect shareholder value.

# Industry Description

The Health Care Delivery industry owns and manages hospitals, clinics, and other health care-related facilities. Companies provide a range of services, including inpatient and outpatient care, surgery, mental health, rehabilitation, and clinical laboratory services. Demand for health care delivery services is driven largely by rates of insurance coverage, demographics, illness, and injury rates. The industry is characterized by high fixed labor and facilities costs, and an increased regulatory emphasis on reduced costs of care and improved outcomes. Health care delivery companies also face significant competition for patients and resources from private, nonprofit, and religious health care systems.

# Industry Description

The Gas Utilities & Distributors industry is made up of gas distribution and marketing companies. Gas distribution involves operating local, low-pressure pipes to transfer natural gas from larger transmission pipes to end users. Gas marketing companies are gas brokers that aggregate natural gas into quantities that fit the needs of their different customers and then deliver it, generally through other companies' transmission and distribution lines. A relatively smaller portion of this industry is involved in propane gas distribution; therefore this standard is focused on natural gas distribution. Both types of gas are commonly used for heating and cooking by residential, commercial, and industrial customers. In structurally regulated markets, the utility is granted a full monopoly over the distribution and sale of natural gas. A regulator must approve the rates utilities charge to avoid the abuse of their monopoly position. In deregulated markets, distribution and marketing are legally separated and customers have a choice of which company to buy their gas from. In this case, a utility is guaranteed a monopoly only over distribution and is legally required to transmit all gas equitably along its pipes for a fixed fee. Overall, companies in the industry are tasked with providing safe, reliable, low-cost gas, while effectively managing their social and environmental impacts, such as community safety and methane emissions.

Note: The SASB Gas Utilities & Distributors industry does not include gas transmission companies that transport highly pressurized natural gas over long distances from the wellhead. Gas transmission companies are included in the Oil & Gas - Midstream industry (EM-MD) in the Extractives & Minerals Processing sector. Furthermore, the SASB standard for the Gas Utilities & Distributors industry covers activities related only to gas provision and not to electricity provision. Some utilities may operate in both gas and electricity markets. Companies undertaking activities related to electricity generation and/or distribution should also consider the separate SASB Standard for the Electric Utilities & Power Generators industry (IF-EU).

45 Note to IF-GU-000.B – The amount of natural gas delivered to residential, commercial, and industrial customers shall be disclosed by bundled gas and transportation service only.

46 Note to IF-GU-000.C – Transmission pipeline is defined according to U.S. 49 CFR 192.3 as a pipeline, other than a gathering line, that: transports gas from a gathering line or storage facility to a distribution center, storage facility, or large volume customer that is not downstream from a distribution center; (2) operates at a hoop stress of 20 percent or more of SMYS; or (3) transports gas within a storage field. A distribution pipeline is defined according to 49 CFR 192.3 as a pipeline other than a gathering or transmission line.

# End-Use Efficiency

## Topic Summary

Natural gas produces fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than other fossil fuels. Its expanded use in the economy is therefore a key strategy for many governments and regulators striving to reduce GHG emissions. Despite the relatively lower emissions, however, the natural gas value chain still produces meaningful levels of GHG emissions overall. As policymakers and regulators look to address climate change, efficient consumption of natural gas will be an important theme over the long term. There is a wide range of measures that utilities can take to promote energy efficiency among their customers, including offering rebates for energy-efficient appliances, weatherizing customers' homes, and educating customers on energy saving methods. How well a utility stands to gain or lose from the trend toward GHG mitigation is significantly predicated on its regulatory environment. Traditional rate structures generally do not give gas utilities an incentive for energy efficiency and, further, they may economically suffer from reductions in customer demand. This is increasingly driving gas utilities, and their regulators and customers, to pursue alternative ratemaking. Such alternative rate design often ""decouples"" utility revenues from customer consumption and may also build in explicit incentives for successful utility performance in terms of end-use efficiency and demand reductions. Overall, companies whose strategic plan includes efficiency initiatives that strive to reduce downside risks from demand fluctuations, gain returns on needed investments, and lower costs are more likely to be well positioned to earn stronger risk-adjusted returns over the long term.

# Integrity of Gas Delivery Infrastructure

## Topic Summary

Operating a vast network of gas pipelines, equipment, and storage facilities requires a multifaceted, long-term approach to ensuring the integrity of such infrastructure, and the management of related risks. While customers depend on constantly available gas supplies, companies are tasked with managing substantial risks—including those related to human health, property, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—that result from operating gas distribution networks and related infrastructure. Aging infrastructure, inadequate monitoring and maintenance, and other operational factors may lead to gas leaks. Gas leaks can result in safety-related risks, such as losses of containment, which may result in fires or explosions that can be particularly severe in urban areas where companies often operate. Furthermore, gas leaks also result in fugitive emissions (methane), causing adverse environmental impacts. Regulated gas utilities generally incur no direct costs for gas leaks, as the cost of gas is typically passed directly to customers (though this may vary by region). However, gas leaks that result in safety-related risks and/or fugitive emissions may financially impact companies through a variety of regulatory, legal, and product demand channels. Accidents, particularly fatal accidents, can result in claims of negligence against companies, leading to costly court battles and fines. GHG emissions may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny—a critical element directly connected to financial performance, given the importance of regulatory relations—and potential fines and penalties. Importantly, regulated gas utilities can also financially benefit from opportunities for capital investments designed to improve performance and mitigate risks related to safety and emissions. These capital investments may lead to higher rate bases, ultimately benefiting the company and its shareholders. Companies seek to manage such risks through pipeline replacements, regular inspections and monitoring, employee training and emergency preparedness, investments in technology, and other strategies—all typically done by working closely with regulators. In many parts of the country, concerns about aging infrastructure have caused companies in the industry to look for ways to expedite the replacement approval process, especially in cases where pipelines are located near densely populated areas.

# Industry Description

The Cruise Lines industry comprises companies that provide passenger transportation and leisure entertainment, including deep sea cruises and river cruises. The industry is dominated by a few large companies. Cruises aim to provide a luxury resort experience for thousands of passengers at a time. The Cruise Lines industry has often been the fastest-growing segment of the travel industry, but is very cyclical.

118 Note to TR-CL-000.A – Available lower berth (ALB) is a measure of the standard capacity of a cruise ship, usually assuming two people per available cabin. It accounts for changes in fleet size, itineraries, and passenger capacity. Available lower berth kilometers (ALB-KM) are computed by multiplying ALB on each leg by the number of kilometers traveled on that leg.

119 Note to TR-CL-000.B – Average passenger cruise days (APCD) is computed as the number of available lower berths on a ship multiplied by the number of days that those berths are available to passengers during the reporting period.

120 Note to TR-CL-000.C – Shipboard employees are those employees who work aboard the entity's vessels (including direct and contract employees) during the reporting period.

121 Note to TR-CL-000.D – Cruise passengers is the number of passengers aboard the entity's vessels, excluding employees.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Cruise lines generate emissions mainly from the combustion of diesel in ship engines. The industry's reliance on heavy fuel oil (""bunker fuel"") is of material concern due to rising fuel costs and intensifying greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations. Evolving environmental regulations are driving the adoption of more fuel-efficient engines, engine retrofits, and the use of cleaner-burning fuels. Fuel constitutes a major expense for industry players, providing a further incentive for investing in upgrades or retrofits to boost fuel efficiency. In addition, violation of GHG regulations can lead to fines and compliance costs.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Chemical manufacturing generates direct (Scope 1) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in manufacturing and cogeneration processes, as well as process emissions from the chemical transformation of feedstocks. GHG emissions can create regulatory compliance costs or penalties and operating risks for chemicals companies. However, resulting financial impacts will vary depending on the magnitude of emissions and the prevailing emissions regulations. The industry may be subject to increasingly stringent regulations as nations seek to limit or reduce emissions. Companies that cost-effectively manage GHG emissions through greater energy efficiency, the use of alternative fuels, or manufacturing process advances may benefit from improved operating efficiency and reduced regulatory risk, among other financial benefits.

## Metrics

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Chemical manufacturing is typically energy-intensive, with energy used to power processing units, cogeneration plants, machinery, and non-manufacturing facilities. The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and energy management strategies depends on the type of products manufactured. Typically, fossil fuels including natural gas and natural gas liquids are the predominant form of non-feedstock energy used, while purchased electricity may also represent a significant share. Therefore, energy purchases can represent a significant share of production costs. A company's energy mix may include energy generated onsite, purchased grid electricity and fossil fuels, and renewable and alternative energy. Tradeoffs in the use of such energy sources include cost, reliability of supply, related water use and air emissions, and regulatory compliance and risk. As such, a company's energy intensity and energy sourcing decisions may affect its operating efficiency and risk profile over time.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Water is a critical input in chemicals production and is used primarily for cooling, steam generation, and feedstock processing. Long-term historic increases in water scarcity and cost, and expectations of continued increases—due to overconsumption and constrained supplies, resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution, and climate change— indicate the heightened importance of water management. Water scarcity can result in a higher risk of operational disruption for companies with water-intensive operations and can also increase water procurement costs and capital expenditures. Meanwhile, chemical manufacturing can generate process wastewater that must be treated before disposal. Non-compliance with water quality regulations may result in regulatory compliance and mitigation costs or legal expenses stemming from litigation. Reducing water use and consumption through increased efficiency and other water management strategies may lead to lower operating costs over time and may mitigate financial impacts of regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions of operations.

# Industry Description

Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production (E&P) companies explore for, extract, or produce energy products such as crude oil and natural gas, which comprise the upstream operations of the oil and gas value chain. Companies in the industry develop conventional and unconventional oil and gas reserves; these include, but are not limited to, shale oil and/or gas reserves, oil sands, and gas hydrates. Activities covered by this standard include the development of both on-shore and off-shore reserves. The E&P industry creates contracts with the Oil and Gas Services industry to conduct several E&P activities and to obtain equipment and oilfield services.

Note: The Standards discussed below are for ""pure-play"" E&P activities, or independent E&P companies. Integrated oil and gas companies conduct upstream operations but are also involved in the distribution and/or refining or marketing of products. SASB has separate standards for the Oil and Gas Midstream (EM-MD) and Refining & Marketing industries (EM-RM). As such, integrated companies should also consider the disclosure topics and metrics from these standards. SASB also has separate standards for Oil and Gas Services (EM-SV).

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Exploration & Production (E&P) activities generate significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a variety of sources. Emissions can be combusted, including those arising from flaring or power generation equipment, as well as uncombusted, including those emissions arising from gas processing equipment, venting, flaring, and fugitive methane. Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG emissions in response to the risks posed by climate change may result in additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for E&P companies. With natural gas production from shale resources expanding, the management of the emission of methane, a highly potent GHG, from oil and gas E&P systems has emerged as a major operational, reputational, and regulatory risk for companies. Furthermore, the development of unconventional hydrocarbon resources may be more or less GHG-intensive than conventional oil and gas, with associated impacts to regulatory risk. Energy efficiency, use of less carbon-intensive fuels, or process improvements to reduce fugitive emissions, venting, and flaring, can provide benefits to E&P companies in the form of climate risk mitigation, lower costs, or increased revenues.

EM-EP-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage methane, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations

1 The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol—carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃).

1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).

1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Depending on the extraction technique, exploration and production operations may consume significant quantities of water, which may expose companies to the risk of reduced water availability, regulations limiting usage, or related cost increases, particularly in water-stressed regions. Contamination of local water resources can result from incidents involving produced water, flowback water, hydraulic fracturing fluids, and other well fluids. Historically, there has been concern regarding the impacts of hydraulic fracturing operations on the contamination of groundwater supplies. Reducing water use and contamination through recycling, other water management strategies, and use of non-toxic fracturing fluids could create operational efficiency for companies and lower their operating costs. Such strategies could also minimize the impacts that regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions have on operations.

## Metrics

EM-EP-140a.1. (1) Total fresh water withdrawn, (2) total fresh water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

# Reserves Valuation & Capital Expenditures

## Topic Summary

Estimates suggest that exploration and production (E&P) companies may be unable to extract a significant proportion of their proved and probable oil and gas reserves if greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are to be controlled to limit global temperature increases to two degrees Celsius as per the Paris Agreement. Companies with more carbon-intensive reserves and production and higher capital costs are likely to face greater risks. Regulatory limits on GHG emissions, together with improved competitiveness of alternative energy technologies, could lower or reduce the growth in global demand, and therefore reduce prices for oil and gas products. Extraction costs could increase with regulations that put a price on GHG emissions. These factors could affect the economic viability to extract oil and gas reserves. Regulatory actions that are more abrupt than anticipated, or those focusing on industries with high emissions, could impair asset values over a short period of time. Stewardship of capital resources and production decisions that take into account near- and long-term trends related to climate change mitigation actions can help prevent current asset impairment and maintain profitability and creditworthiness.

## Metrics

EM-EP-420a.1. Sensitivity of hydrocarbon reserve levels to future price projection scenarios that account for a price on carbon emissions

1 The entity shall perform a sensitivity analysis of its reserves to determine how several future scenarios may affect its determination of whether the reserves are proved or probable.

2 The entity shall analyze the sensitivity of its current proven and probable reserves using the price trajectories published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its World Energy Outlook (WEO) publication, including:

2.1 Current Policies Scenario, which assumes no changes in policies from the mid-point of the year of publication of the WEO.

2.2 New Policies Scenario, which assumes that broad policy commitments and plans that have been announced by countries (including national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and plans to phase out fossil-energy subsidies), occur even if the measures to implement these commitments have yet to be identified or announced. This broadly serves as the IEA baseline scenario.

2.3 Sustainable Development Scenario, which assumes that an energy pathway occurs that is consistent with the goal of limiting the global increase in temperature to 1.5°C by limiting concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

2.4 The entity shall consider the WEO scenarios as a normative reference, thus any updates to the WEO made year-on-year shall be considered updates to this guidance.

#### Page 104

# Industry-based disclosure requirements

3 The entity shall follow the applicable jurisdictional guidance for the following:

3.1 Classifying of reserves as proved and probable.

3.2 Conducting a reserves sensitivity analysis and disclosing, in the aggregate, an estimate of reserves for each product type based on different price and cost criteria, such as a range of prices and costs that may reasonably be achieved, including standardized futures prices or management's own forecasts.

3.2.1 The entity shall disclose the price and cost schedules and assumptions on which disclosed values are based.

3.3 Determining current case of reserve levels.

4 The entity may use the following table format to summarize its findings:

# Industry Description

The Mortgage Finance industry provides an essential public good in enabling consumers to purchase homes, and contributes to the overall home ownership rate. Companies in the industry lend capital to individual and commercial customers with property as collateral. The primary products are residential and commercial mortgages, while other services offered include: mortgage servicing, title insurance, closing and settlement services, and valuation. In addition, mortgage finance firms own, manage, and finance real estate related investments such as mortgage pass-through certificates and collateralized mortgage obligations. Recent trends in the regulatory environment indicate a significant shift toward consumer protection, disclosure, and accountability. Legislation passed in response to the 2008 mortgage crisis demonstrates the potential for further alignment between the interests of society and those of long-term investors.

# Industry Description

The Rail Transportation industry consists of companies that provide rail freight shipping and support services. Key activities include shipping containerized and bulk freight, including consumer goods and commodities. Rail companies typically own, maintain, and operate their rail networks, which may require significant capital expenditures. The U.S. operates the longest railroad network in the world, followed closely by Russia, China, India, Canada, Germany, and France. The industry exhibits economies of density due to its network effects, lending itself to natural monopoly conditions. Together with the large sunk costs of rail infrastructure, this provides a competitive advantage to incumbent firms in the industry and creates barriers to entry for new firms.

Note: The scope of the Rail Transportation industry does not include passenger rail transportation.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

The Rail Transportation industry generates emissions mainly through the combustion of diesel in locomotive engines. Despite relatively low emissions compared to other transportation industries, fuel management has implications for companies in the industry in terms of operating costs and regulatory compliance. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) including carbon dioxide (CO₂) are of particular importance to government regulators concerned about climate change. Intensifying regulation of locomotive exhaust emissions and high fuel costs provide incentives for rail companies to invest in fuel efficiency enhancements to manage emissions. This can increase operational efficiency and impact the cost structure of rail companies, with chronic and acute impacts on value and competitive position both within the industry and compared to other modes of transport.

# Fleet Fuel Management

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Food Retailers & Distributors industry own and operate vehicle fleets to deliver products between its distribution and retail locations. The fuel consumption of vehicle fleets is a significant industry expense, both in terms of operating costs and associated capital expenditures. Fossil fuel consumption can contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. These environmental impacts have the potential to affect food retailers and distributors through regulatory exposure. Efficiencies gained in fuel use can reduce costs, mitigate exposure to fossil fuel price volatility, and limit the carbon footprint associated with storage and transportation. Short-term capital expenditures in fuel-efficient fleets and more energy efficient technologies may be outweighed by long-term operational savings and decreased exposure to regulatory risks.

## Metrics

### FB-FR-110a.1. Fleet fuel consumed, percentage renewable

1    The entity shall disclose the total amount of fuel consumed by its fleet vehicles as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

1.2.1    Adding fuel purchases made during the reporting period to beginning inventory at the start of the reporting period, less any fuel inventory at the end of the reporting period

1.2.2    Tracking fuel consumed by vehicles

1.2.3    Tracking fuel expenses

2    The entity shall disclose the percentage of the total amount of fuel consumed by its fleet vehicles that is renewable fuel.

2.1    Renewable fuel is generally defined as fuel that meets all of the following requirements:

2.1.1    Produced from renewable biomass;

2.1.2    Used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel present in a transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel; and

2.1.3    Achieved net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction on a life cycle basis.

2.2    The entity shall disclose the standard or regulation used to determine if a fuel is renewable.

# Air Emissions from Refrigeration

## Topic Summary

Emissions of refrigeration chemicals from equipment used to store and display perishable foods pose unique regulatory risks for the Food Retailers & Distributors industry. International regulations on hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) aim to mitigate damage by HCFCs to the Earth's ozone layer. Additionally, many common HCFCs and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are highly potent greenhouse gases (GHGs), which increases the industry's exposure to climate change-related regulations. Regulators can assess penalties to companies that violate emissions standards, while companies may be required to upgrade or replace equipment, requiring capital expenditures, to reduce their emissions or replace existing refrigerants with potentially costlier, but less environmentally-damaging alternatives.

## Metrics

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Food retail and distribution facilities are typically more energy-intensive than other types of commercial spaces. Energy is used predominately for refrigeration, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), as well as lighting. Companies in the industry generally purchase the majority of consumed electricity, while some are beginning to generate energy on-site or add renewable energy into their energy mix. Energy production and consumption contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution, which have the potential to indirectly, yet materially, impact the operations of food retailers and distributors. Companies that manage their overall energy use through increased efficiency and use of alternative energy sources can increase profitability by lowering expenses and reducing risk.

# Management of Environmental & Social Impacts in the Supply Chain

## Topic Summary

Food retailers and distributors source merchandise from a wide range of manufacturers. These suppliers face a myriad of sustainability-related challenges that include resource conservation, water scarcity, animal welfare, fair labor practices, and climate change. When poorly managed, these issues can affect the price and availability of food. Additionally, consumers are increasingly concerned with the production methods, origins, and externalities associated with the foods they purchase, which may affect a company's reputation. Food retailers and distributors can also work with suppliers on packaging design to generate cost savings in transport, improve brand reputation, and reduce the environmental impact. Companies that can address product supply risks by assessing and engaging with suppliers, implementing sustainable sourcing guidelines, and enhancing supply chain transparency will likely be better positioned to improve supply chain resiliency, mitigate reputational risks, and potentially increase consumer demand or capture new market opportunities.

# Industry Description

The Home Builders industry is comprised of companies that develop new homes and residential communities. Development efforts generally include the acquisition of land, site preparation, the construction of homes, and home sales. The majority of industry activity is focused on the development and sale of single-family homes, which are typically part of company-designed residential communities. A smaller segment is centered on townhomes, condominiums, multi-family housing, and mixed-use development. Many companies in the industry offer financing services to individual homebuyers. The industry is fragmented, as there is a large number of developers of all sizes, which vary in company structure and geographic focus. Listed companies tend to be significantly larger, and more integrated than the numerous privately held home builders.

# Land Use & Ecological Impacts

## Topic Summary

Home builders face challenges directly related to the ecological impacts of development activities. Developments often take place on previously undeveloped land, and companies must manage the ecosystem disruption of construction activities as well as the regulations and permitting processes that accompany ""greenfield"" land development. Regardless of the siting decisions companies make, industry development activities generally carry risks related to land and water contamination, mismanagement of waste, and excessive strain on water resources during the construction and use phases. Violation of environmental regulations can result in costly fines and delays that decrease financial returns while potentially harming reputations. Companies with repeated violations or track records of prior activities with excessive ecological impacts may find it difficult to receive approval from local communities for new developments, thereby decreasing future revenue and market share. Companies that concentrate development efforts in water-stressed regions may see further challenges to permitting approvals, and also face risks related to land or home depreciation due to water shortage concerns. Environmental quality control procedures, ""smart growth"" strategies (including a focus on redevelopment sites), and conservation strategies may help ensure compliance with environmental laws, and therefore mitigate financial risks, while improving future growth opportunities.

# Design for Resource Efficiency

## Topic Summary

Residential buildings, when occupied, consume significant amounts of energy and water. Companies in the Home Builders industry can improve the resource efficiency of homes over their lifecycle through sustainable design practices and choice of materials. Energy-saving products and techniques such as designing homes for efficient heating and cooling can help to reduce dependence on energy, whether it comes from the electric grid or onsite fuel combustion. These measures, which are intended to improve the resource efficiency of homes, can decrease the costs of home ownership through lower utility bills. Water saving features such as low-flow faucets alleviate strain on local communities, while likely also lowering costs. Homebuyer awareness of the importance of the energy and water efficiency creates a potential for companies to increase demand in their target market, thereby increasing revenue and/or margins. Effectively applying resource efficiency design principles in a cost-effective manner may serve as a competitive advantage, especially when companies are successful in systematically educating customers on the long-term benefits of these homes.

# Climate Change Adaptation

## Topic Summary

The impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events and changing climate patterns, may impact the markets companies select to develop homes and residential communities. Companies with business models that incorporate ongoing assessments of climate change risks, and adapt to such risks, are likely to more effectively grow company value over the long term, partially through reductions in risk. More specifically, strategies focused on home development activities in floodplains and coastal regions that are exposed to extreme weather events, such as flooding, have increased needs for their business models to adapt to climate change, especially considering long-term challenges like flood insurance rates, the financial stability of government-subsidized flood insurance programs, permitting approvals, and financing stipulations. Rising climate risks and the increasing cost of occupying properties in volatile regions may translate into reduced long-term demand, land value depreciation, and concerns over understated long-term costs of home ownership. Additionally, companies that build developments in water-stressed regions risk losing land value and may face problems with permitting approvals. The active assessment of climate change risks and a holistic view of long-term homebuyer demand may enable companies to successfully adapt to such risks.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Coal operations are energy intensive and generate significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including carbon dioxide from fuel use and methane released from coal beds during mining and post-mining activities. Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG emissions in response to the risks posed by climate change may result in higher operating and capital expenditures based on the magnitude of their direct emissions. Operational efficiencies can be achieved through the cost-effective reduction of GHG emissions. Such efficiencies can mitigate the potential financial impact of increased fuel costs from regulations that seek to limit—or put a price on—GHG emissions.

## Metrics

EM-CO-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations

1. The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol—carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃).

    1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).

    1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.

2. Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).

    2.1 These emissions include direct emissions of GHGs from stationary or mobile sources; these sources include but are not limited to: equipment at mine sites, mine mouth electric generating facilities, coal seam methane emissions, production and processing facilities, storage facilities, office buildings, and transportation (marine, road, and rail).

3    The entity shall disclose the percentage of its gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions that are covered under an emissions-limiting regulation or program that is intended to directly limit or reduce emissions, such as cap-and-trade schemes, carbon tax/fee systems, and other emissions control (e.g., command-and-control approach) and permit-based mechanisms.

3.1    Examples of emissions-limiting regulations include, but are not limited to:

3.1.1    California Cap-and-Trade (California Global Warming Solutions Act)

3.1.2    European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)

3.1.3    Quebec Cap-and-Trade (Draft Bill 42 of 2009)

3.2    The percentage shall be calculated as the total amount of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions (CO2-e) that are covered under emissions-limiting regulations divided by the total amount of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions (CO2-e).

3.2.1    For emissions that are subject to multiple emissions-limiting regulations, the entity shall not account for those emissions more than once.

3.3    The scope of emissions-limiting regulations excludes emissions covered under voluntary emissions-limiting regulations (e.g., voluntary trading systems), as well as reporting-based regulations.

4    The entity may discuss any change in its emissions from the previous reporting period, including whether the change was due to emissions reductions, divestment, acquisition, mergers, changes in output, and/or changes in calculation methodology.

#### Page 45

5    In the case that current reporting of GHG emissions to the CDP or other entity (e.g., a national regulatory disclosure program) differs in terms of the scope and consolidation approach used, the entity may disclose those emissions. However, primary disclosure shall be according to the guidelines described above.

6    The entity may discuss the calculation methodology for its emissions disclosure, such as if data are from continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS), engineering calculations, or mass balance calculations.

1    The entity shall discuss its long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage its Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

1.1    Scope 1 emissions are defined according to The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).

1.2    The scope of GHG emissions includes the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol—carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃).

2    The entity shall discuss its emission reduction target(s) and analyze its performance against the target(s), including the following, where relevant:

2.1    The scope of the emission reduction target (e.g., the percentage of total emissions to which the target is applicable);

2.2    Whether the target is absolute- or intensity-based, and the metric denominator, if it is an intensity-based target;

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Coal operations have an impact on both the quality and quantity of local water resources. Coal operations are water intensive. The use of water in coal washing to remove sulfur, in cooling drilling equipment, and in transporting coal in slurry pipelines can impact resources. The severity of these risks can vary depending on the region's water availability and the regulatory environment. Reducing water use and contamination could also create operational efficiencies for companies and lower their operating costs. Wastewater treatment and discharge is often regulated by national or local agencies. Violating limits on selenium, sulfate, and dissolved solids could affect coal operations companies through significant penalties, compliance costs, delays in production, or higher costs related to mine closure.

## Metrics

EM-CO-140a.1. (1) Total fresh water withdrawn, (2) percentage recycled, (3) percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from freshwater sources:

1.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local statutes and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no regulatory definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1000 parts per million of dissolved solids.

1.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.

2 The entity shall disclose the percentage of water recycled as the volume, in thousands of cubic meters, recycled divided by the volume of water withdrawn.

2.1 Any volume of water reused multiple times shall be counted as recycled each time it is recycled and reused.

3 The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40-80%) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.

4 The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn.

3 The scope of disclosure shall only include incidents of non-compliance that resulted in a formal enforcement action(s).

3.1 Formal enforcement actions are defined as governmental recognized actions that address a violation or threatened violation of water quantity and/or quality laws, regulations, policies, or orders, and can result in administrative penalty orders, administrative orders, and judicial actions, among others.

4 Violations shall be disclosed, regardless of their measurement methodology or frequency. These include violations for:

4.1 Continuous discharges, limitations, standards, and prohibitions that are generally expressed as maximum daily, weekly average, and monthly averages

4.2 Non-continuous discharges and limitations that are generally expressed in terms of frequency, total mass, maximum rate of discharge, and mass or concentration of specified pollutants

#### Page 49

# Reserves Valuation & Capital Expenditures

## Topic Summary

Estimates suggest that coal companies may be unable to extract a significant proportion of their coal reserves if greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are to be controlled to limit global temperature increases to two degrees Celsius per the Paris Agreement. Stewardship of capital resources while taking into account medium- to long-term trends, particularly related to climate change mitigation actions, is critical in order to prevent asset impairment and maintain profitability and creditworthiness. Globally, regulations and policies are and may continue to be put into place to limit GHG emissions from coal-fired power plants—the customers of coal companies—thus lowering the demand for, and subsequently the prices of, coal. Coal demand is also being affected by regulations governing other harmful air emissions that apply to coal-fired power plants. An expansion of GHG-mitigation regulations may increase the magnitude of potential financial impacts in the medium to long term. Along with improved competitiveness of alternative energy technologies, this poses a long-term risk for the reserves and capital expenditures of coal operations companies.

## Metrics

EM-CO-420a.1. Sensitivity of coal reserve levels to future price projection scenarios that account for a price on carbon emissions

1    The entity shall perform a sensitivity analysis of its reserves to determine how several future scenarios may affect its determination of whether the reserves are proven or probable.

2    The entity shall analyze the sensitivity of its current proven and probable reserves using the price trajectories published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its World Energy Outlook (WEO) publication, including:

2.1    Current Policies Scenario, which assumes no changes in policies from the mid-point of the year of publication of the WEO.

2.2    New Policies Scenario, which assumes that broad policy commitments and plans that have been announced by countries—including national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and plans to phase out fossil-energy subsidies—occur, even if the measures to implement these commitments have yet to be identified or announced. This broadly serves as the IEA baseline scenario.

2.3    Sustainable Development Scenario, which assumes an energy pathway occurs that is consistent with the goal of limiting the global increase in temperature to 2°C 1.5°C by limiting concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

2.4    The entity shall consider the WEO scenarios as a normative reference, thus any updates to the WEO made year-on-year shall be considered updates to this guidance.

#### Page 50

2.5 Reserves, as that part of a are defined as mineral deposit that could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.

2.6 Proven reserves, as are reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings, or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are spaced so closely and the geographic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth, and mineral content of reserves are well established.

2.7 Probable reserves, as are reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.

3 The entity shall conduct a reserves sensitivity analysis and disclose, in the aggregate, an estimate of reserves estimated for each product type based on different price and cost criteria, such as a range of prices and costs that may reasonably be achieved, including standardized futures prices or management's own forecasts.

4 The entity shall also disclose the price and cost schedules and assumptions on which disclosed values are based.

5 The entity may summarize its findings in the following table format:

Table 1. Sensitivity of Reserves to Prices By Principal Product Type and Price Scenario

PRICE CASE | PROVEN RESERVES | PROBABLE RESERVES
--- | --- | ---
(Scenario) | Coal | Product A | Coal | Product A
 | (tons) | (measure) | (tons) | (measure)
Current Policies Scenario (base) |  |  |  | 
New Policies Scenario |  |  |  | 
Sustainable Development Scenario |  |  |  | 

#### Page 51

6 The entity may disclose the sensitivity of its reserve levels in other price and demand scenarios in addition to those described above, particularly if these scenarios differ depending on the type of coal reserves, regulatory environment in the countries or regions where mining occurs, end-use of the entity's products, or other factors.

7  For additional sensitivity analyses, the entity should consider disclosing the following, per the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Recommendations Report Figure 8 as well as the Implementing the Recommendations of the TCFD Report, Section E:

7.1 The alternative scenarios used, including other 2°C or lower scenarios.

7.2 Critical input parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices for the climate-related scenarios used, particularly as they relate to key areas such as policy assumptions, energy deployment pathways, technology pathways, and related timing assumptions.

7.3 Time frames used for scenarios, including short-, medium-, and long-term milestones (e.g., how organizations consider timing of potential future implications under the scenarios used).

EM-CO-420a.2. Estimated carbon dioxide emissions embedded in proven coal reserves

1    The entity shall calculate and disclose an estimate of the carbon dioxide emissions embedded in its proven coal reserves.

1.1    Nota bene — this estimate applies a factor for potential CO2 only and does not include an estimate for all potential greenhouse gas emissions, as these are dependent on downstream use (e.g., utility electricity generation, industrial heating and electricity generation, cement production, or steel production).

2    Estimated potential carbon dioxide emissions from proven coal reserves shall be calculated according to the following formula, derived from Meinshausen et al:

2.1    E = R × V × C, where:

2.1.1    E are the potential emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide (kg CO2);

2.1.2    R are the proven reserves in gigagrams (Gg);

2.1.3    V is the net calorific value in terajoules per gigagram (TJ/Gg); and

2.1.4    C is the effective carbon dioxide emission factor in kilograms CO2 per terajoule (kg/TJ).

3    In the absence of data specific to the entity's coal reserves, carbon content shall be calculated using default data for each major type of coal resource published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

#### Page 52

3.1    The entity shall use default carbon content values per unit of energy that is listed in IPCC Table 1.3 Default Values of Carbon Content, Volume 2: Energy, Chapter 1.

3.2    The entity shall use calorific values per weight of coal resource contained in IPCC Table 1.2 Default Net Calorific Values (NCVs) and Lower and Upper Limit of the 95% Confidence Intervals, Volume 2: Energy, Chapter 1.

4    The entity shall use engineering estimates to determine the weight of its coal reserves in gigagrams.

5    For other assumptions required to estimate the carbon content of coal reserves, the entity shall rely on guidance from the IPCC, Greenhouse Gas Protocol, U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA), or the International Energy Agency (IEA).

EM-CO-420a.3. Discussion of how price and demand for coal and/or climate regulation influence the capital expenditure strategy for exploration, acquisition, and development of assets

1    The entity shall discuss how projections for price and demand for coal and the path of air quality and climate regulation influence the entity's capital expenditure (CAPEX) strategy.

1.1    This discussion should include the entity's projections and assumptions about future coal prices and the likelihood that certain price and demand scenarios occur.

2    The entity shall discuss the implications of price and demand scenario planning (i.e., EM-CO-420a.1) and how they may affect decisions to explore, acquire, and develop new reserves.

3    The entity may discuss factors that materially influence its CAPEX decision making, including, but not limited to:

3.1    How the scope of air quality and climate change regulation—such as which countries, regions, and/or industries are likely to be impacted—may influence where the entity focuses its exploration and development

3.2    Its view of the alignment between the time horizon during which price and demand for coal may be affected by climate regulation and time horizons for returns on capital expenditures on reserves

3.3    How the structure of climate regulation—i.e., a carbon tax versus cap-and-trade—may differently affect price and demand, and thus the entity's capital expenditure decision making

4    The entity may discuss how these trends affect decision-making in the context of different types of reserve expenditures, including development of assets, acquisition of properties with proven reserves, acquisition of properties with unproven resources, and exploration activities.

# Industry Description

The Asset Management & Custody Activities industry is comprised of companies that manage investment portfolios on a commission or fee basis for institutional, retail, and high net-worth investors. In addition, firms in this industry provide wealth management, private banking, financial planning, and investment advisory and retail securities brokerage services. Investment portfolios and strategies may be diversified across multiple asset classes, which include, but are not limited to, equities, fixed income, and hedge fund investments. Specific companies are engaged in venture capital and private equity investments. The industry provides an essential service in assisting a range of customers from individual retail investors to large, institutional asset owners to meet specified investment goals. Companies in the industry range from large multinational asset managers with a wide range of investable products, strategies, and asset classes to small boutique firms providing services to a very specific market niche. While large firms generally compete on the basis of management fees charged for their services as well as their potential to generate superior investment performance, the smaller firms generally compete on their ability to provide products and services geared towards individual clients to satisfy their diversification needs. The 2008 financial crisis and subsequent regulatory developments highlight the social impact of the industry in terms of providing fair advice to customers and managing risks at the entity, portfolio, and economy-wide levels.

# Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Investment Management & Advisory

## Topic Summary

Asset management and custody activities companies maintain a fiduciary responsibility to their clients. These companies must therefore consider and incorporate an analysis of all material information into investment decisions, including environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. The process of ESG incorporation involves consideration of ESG factors in valuation, modeling, portfolio construction, proxy voting, and engagement with investees and, as a result, in investment decision-making by asset and wealth managers. As the management and use of non-financial forms of capital increasingly contribute to market value, incorporation of ESG factors in analysis of investees has become more relevant. Research has established that a company's management of certain ESG factors can materially impact both its accounting and market returns. Therefore, deep understanding of investees' ESG performance, integration of ESG factors in valuation and modeling, as well as engagement with investees on sustainability issues allows asset managers to generate superior returns. On the other hand, asset management and custody activities companies that fail to consider these risks and opportunities in their investment management activities could see diminished investment returns in their portfolios which would lead to reduced performance fees. Over the long term, it could result in outflow of assets under management (AUM) resulting in the loss of market share and lower management fees.

# Transition Risk Exposure

## Topic Summary

Asset management and custody activities entities maintain a fiduciary responsibility to their clients and therefore consider all material information in their investment decisions. Transition risks and opportunities stemming from, for example, policy change, emerging regulation or technological innovation, are becoming more prevalent and are therefore increasingly being factored into investment decision making. A core component of identifying and assessing these risks and opportunities is the ability to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of investment portfolios, a concept commonly referred to as 'financed emissions.' Failure to manage this risk could result in diminished investment returns in an asset manager's investment portfolios, which in turn may lead to reduced performance fees. Over the long term, mismanagement of this risk could precipitate an outflow of assets under management (AUM) resulting in the loss of market share and lower revenue . On the other hand, investment opportunities may arise from effective management of this risk, leading to increased performance and fee income from increased AUM, thus strengthening market share.

# Industry Description

The Oil and Gas - Midstream industry consists of companies involved in the transportation or storage of natural gas, crude oil, and refined petroleum products. Midstream natural gas activities involve gathering, transport, and processing of natural gas from the wellhead, as well as the removal of impurities, production of natural gas liquids, storage, pipeline transport, and shipping. liquefaction, or regasification of liquefied natural gas. Midstream oil activities mainly involve transport of crude oil and refined products over land, using a network of pipes and pumping stations, as well as trucks and rail cars, and over seas and rivers via tanker ships or barges. Companies that operate bulk stations and terminals, as well as those that manufacture and install storage tanks and pipelines, are also part of this industry.

Note: The standards discussed below are for ""pure-play"" midstream activities or independent midstream companies. Integrated oil and gas companies may own or operate midstream operations, but are also involved in the upstream operations of the oil and gas value chain and in the refining or marketing of products. SASB has separate standards for the Oil and Gas Exploration & Production (EM-EP) and Refining & Marketing industries (EM-MD). As such, integrated companies should also consider the disclosure topics and metrics from these standards.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

The midstream industry generates significant quantities of greenhouse gases and other air emissions from compressor engine exhausts, oil and condensate tank vents, natural gas processing, and fugitive emissions, in addition to emissions from mobile sources. GHG emissions contribute to climate change and create additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for midstream companies due to climate change mitigation policies. At the same time, the management of fugitive emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, has emerged as a major operational, reputational, and regulatory risk. Financial impacts on companies will vary depending on the specific location of operations and the prevailing emissions regulations, and include higher operating or capital expenditures and regulatory or legal penalties. Companies that capture and monetize, or cost-effectively reduce emissions by implementing innovative monitoring and mitigation efforts and fuel efficiency measures could enjoy several benefits. These companies have the opportunity to reduce regulatory risks and to realize operational efficiencies in an environment of increasing regulatory and public concerns about air quality and climate change.

## Industry Description

The Engineering & Construction Services industry provides engineering, construction, design, consulting, contracting, and other related services that support various building and infrastructure projects. The industry is primarily made up of four major segments: engineering services, infrastructure construction, non-residential building construction, and building sub-contractors and construction-related professional services. The infrastructure construction segment includes companies that design and/or build infrastructure projects such as power plants, dams, oil and gas pipelines, refineries, highways, bridges, tunnels, railways, ports, airports, waste treatment plants, water networks, and stadiums. The non-residential building construction segment includes companies that design and/or build industrial and commercial facilities such as factories, warehouses, data centers, offices, hotels, hospitals, universities, and retail spaces like malls. The engineering services segment includes companies that provide specialized architectural and engineering services such as design and development of feasibility studies for many of the project types listed above. Finally, the building sub-contractors and other construction-related professional services segment includes smaller companies that provide ancillary services such as carpentry, electrical, plumbing, painting, waterproofing, landscaping, interior design, and building inspection. The industry's customers include infrastructure owners and developers in the public and private sectors. Large companies in this industry operate and generate revenue globally and typically specialize in multiple segments.

# Environmental Impacts of Project Development

## Topic Summary

Infrastructure construction projects help improve economic and social development; however, they can also pose risks to the local environment and surrounding communities. Industry activities can disrupt local ecosystems through biodiversity impacts, emissions into the air, water discharges, natural resource consumption, waste generation, and the use of hazardous chemicals. In particular, construction companies perform clearing, grading, and excavation activities and may generate harmful waste during project construction. Effectively assessing environmental impacts prior to construction may help mitigate unforeseen issues that can raise operational and capital costs. In some cases, environmental concerns and/or local community pushback can result in project delays and, in extreme cases, project cancellations, which may impact a company's profitability and growth opportunities. A failure to comply with environmental regulations during construction can result in costly fines and remediation costs, and can damage a company's reputation. Environmental impact assessments can provide an understanding of a project's potential environmental impacts and the mitigation activities that may be necessary before it begins. Likewise, proper management of environmental risks during project construction can reduce regulatory oversight and/or community pushback. By assessing environmental considerations up front, as well as continuing to evaluate them during project development, engineering and construction companies may be better prepared to mitigate the potential environmental issues and financial risks that may occur, while also establishing a competitive advantage for obtaining new contracts with prospective clients.

# Structural Integrity & Safety

## Topic Summary

Whether providing engineering, design, architectural, consulting, inspection, construction, or maintenance services, companies in this industry have a professional responsibility to ensure the safety and integrity of their work. Errors or inadequate quality in the project design phase and construction of buildings or infrastructure can cause significant personal injury, loss of property value, and economic harm. Companies that perform poorly on structural integrity and safety can therefore face potentially high costs due to redesign and/or repair work and legal liabilities, as well as reputational damage that could hurt growth prospects. Moreover, when designing and constructing buildings or infrastructure, companies in the industry must increasingly contemplate potential climate change impacts, which may affect the structural integrity of projects and the safety of the general public. Compliance with minimum applicable codes and standards may not be sufficient for maintaining and growing reputational value (or even mitigating legal liabilities) in certain circumstances, especially if the frequency and severity of climate-change-related events increases as expected. Meeting or exceeding new industry standards for quality and establishing internal control procedures to address potential design issues, including those resulting from climate risks, are practices that can help companies reduce these risks.

# Lifecycle Impacts of Buildings & Infrastructure

## Topic Summary

Buildings and major infrastructure projects are among the largest users of natural resources in the economy; during construction, these materials include iron and steel products, cement, concrete, bricks, drywall, wallboards, glass, insulation, fixtures, doors, and cabinetry, among others. Once completed, and during their daily use, these projects often consume significant amounts of resources in the form of energy and water (for a discussion on direct environmental impacts from project construction see the Environmental Impacts of Project Development topic). Therefore, the sourcing of construction materials and the everyday use of buildings and infrastructure can contribute to direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, global and/or local resource constraints, water stress, and negative human health outcomes. Client and regulatory pressures to develop a sustainable built environment are contributing to the growth of markets intended to reduce the lifecycle impacts of buildings and infrastructure projects. In response, various international sustainable building and infrastructure certification schemes have been developed to assess, among other aspects, a project's use-phase energy and water efficiency, impacts on human health, and the use of sustainable construction and building materials. As a result, multiple opportunities are being created for industries in the value chain—from suppliers that can provide such materials, to companies in the Engineering & Construction Services industry that can provide sustainability-oriented project design, consulting, and construction services. Such services can provide a competitive advantage and revenue growth opportunities as client demand for economically advantageous sustainable projects increases and related regulations evolve. Companies unable to effectively integrate such considerations into their services may stand to lose market share in the long term.

#### Page 331

# Climate Impacts of Business Mix

## Topic Summary

The Engineering & Construction Services industry works with clients that are exposed to potentially disruptive climate regulation as well as those that play a role in addressing climate change. Certain types of construction projects are significant contributors toward climate change due to the greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted during their use phase. Projects that are likely to contribute to global GHG emissions include those in the oil and gas space and other extractives industries, as well as large buildings. While some infrastructure projects, such as renewable energy projects, are designed to reduce GHG emissions, many types of projects present trade-offs. Mass transit systems, for example, may be direct contributors of GHG emissions while lowering net emissions once the benefits offered by the system are factored in. Several companies in the industry generate a substantial share of revenues and profits from clients in carbon-intensive industries and whose future capital expenditures may be at risk due to evolving climate regulations. Downside risks may manifest through project delays, cancellations, and diminished long-term revenue growth opportunities. On the other hand, companies that specialize in infrastructure projects that contribute to GHG mitigation could develop competitive advantages as they continue to focus on these growing markets. As the industry and its customers continue to operate within an uncertain business environment and face increasing environmental and regulatory requirements, assessing and communicating the risks and opportunities stemming from climate change that are embedded in a company's backlog and future business prospects can be helpful for investors in assessing the overall impact of climate change on the business.

# Environmental Footprint of Hardware Infrastructure

## Topic Summary

With the growth of cloud-based service offerings, companies in this industry own, operate, or rent increasingly more data centers and other hardware; thus, managing the energy and water use associated with IT hardware infrastructure is important to shareholder value. Data centers need to be powered continuously, and disruptions to the energy supply can have a material impact on operations, depending on the magnitude and timing of the disruption. Companies face a tradeoff between energy and water consumption due to data center cooling needs; cooling data centers with water instead of chillers is a means of improving energy efficiency, but it can lead to dependence on significant local water resources. Decisions about data center specifications are important for managing costs, obtaining a reliable supply of energy and water, and lowering reputational risks, particularly as there is an increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and as opportunities arise from innovations in energy efficiency and renewable energy.

# Industry Description

The Road Transportation industry consists of companies that provide long- and short-haul freight trucking services. Key activities include the shipment of containerized and bulk freight, including consumer goods and a wide variety of commodities. The industry is commonly broken down into two categories: truckload (vehicles carrying the goods of only one customer) and less-than-truckload (vehicles carrying the goods of multiple customers). Owner-operators comprise the vast majority of the industry due to the relative ease of entry, while a few large operators maintain market share through contracts with major shippers. Large companies often subcontract with owner-operators to supplement their owned fleet.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

The Road Transportation industry generates emissions mainly through the combustion of diesel and other fuels in truck engines. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) including carbon dioxide (CO₂) are of particular importance to government regulators concerned about climate change and to consumers demanding low-carbon or carbon-neutral transportation solutions. As GHG emissions from trucks constitute a significant portion of transportation-related emissions, the industry is a focal point for regulations to limit GHG emissions. Changes to operations that increase fuel efficiency offer an effective way for companies to reduce fuel costs while also limiting exposure to volatile fuel pricing, regulatory costs, and other consequences of GHG emissions. While newer trucks are more fuel-efficient, measures can be taken to improve efficiency and reduce emissions in existing fleets.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Manufacturing in the Fuel Cells & Industrial Batteries industry requires energy to power machines and cooling, ventilation, lighting, and product-testing systems. Purchased electricity can represent a major share of the energy sources used in the industry and can account for a notable proportion of the total cost of materials and value added. Various sustainability factors are contributing to an increase in the cost of conventional electricity while making alternative sources cost-competitive. Energy efficiency efforts can have a significant positive impact on operational efficiency and profitability, especially given the fact that many companies operate on relatively low or negative margins. By improving the efficiency of the manufacturing process and exploring alternative energy sources, fuel cell and industrial battery companies can reduce both their indirect environmental impacts and their operating expenses.

# Industry Description

The Iron & Steel Producers industry consists of steel producers with iron and steel mills and companies with iron and steel foundries. The steel producers segment consists of companies that produce iron and steel products from their own mills. These products include flat-rolled sheets, tin plates, pipes, tubes, and products made of stainless steel, titanium, and high alloy steels. Iron and steel foundries, which cast various products, typically purchase iron and steel from other firms. The industry also includes metal service centers and other metal merchant wholesalers, which distribute, import, or export ferrous products. Steel production occurs via two primary methods: the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF), which uses iron ore as an input, and the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF), which uses scrap steel. Many companies in the industry operate on an international scale. Note: With a few exceptions, most companies do not mine their own ore to manufacture steel and iron products. There are separate SASB standards for the Metals & Mining (EM-MM) industry.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Iron and steel production generates significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily of carbon dioxide and methane, from production processes and on-site fuel combustion. While technological improvements have reduced the GHG emissions per ton of steel produced, steel production remains carbon-intensive relative to other industries. Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG emissions in response to the risks posed by climate change may result additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for iron and steel companies due to climate change mitigation policies. Operational efficiencies can be achieved through the cost-effective reduction of GHG emissions. Such efficiencies can mitigate the potential financial impact of increased fuel costs from regulations that seek to limit—or put a price on—GHG emissions.

## Metrics

EM-IS-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations

1    The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol—carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).

    1.1    Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).

3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as the total amount of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions (CO2-e) that are covered under emissions-limiting regulations divided by the total amount of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions (CO2-e).

3.2.1 For emissions that are subject to multiple emissions-limiting regulations, the entity shall not account for those emissions more than once.

3.3 The scope of emissions-limiting regulations excludes emissions covered under voluntary emissions-limiting regulations (e.g., voluntary trading systems), as well as reporting-based regulations.

4 The entity may discuss any change in its emissions from the previous reporting period, including whether the change was due to emissions reductions, divestment, acquisition, mergers, changes in output, and/or changes in calculation methodology.

#### Page 73

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

The production of steel requires significant quantities of energy, sourced primarily from the direct combustion of fossil fuels as well as energy purchased from the grid. Energy-intense production has implications for climate change and electricity purchases from the grid can result in indirect Scope 2 emissions. The choice between different production processes—electric arc furnaces and integrated basic oxygen furnace—can influence whether a company uses fossil fuels or purchases electricity. This decision, together with the choice between using coal versus natural gas or on-site versus grid-sourced electricity, can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of energy supply. Affordable, easily accessible, and reliable energy is an important competitive factor in this industry, with energy costs accounting for a substantial portion of manufacturing costs. The way in which an iron and steel company manages its overall energy efficiency, its reliance on different types of energy and associated sustainability risks, and its ability to access alternative sources of energy can influence its profitability.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Steel production requires a substantial amount of water. Companies face operational, regulatory, and reputational risks due to water scarcity, costs of water acquisition, regulations on effluents or amount of water used, and competition with local communities and other industries for limited water resources. This is the case especially in regions of water scarcity, due to potential water availability constraints and price volatility. Companies that are unable to secure a stable water supply could face production disruptions, while rising water prices could directly increase production costs. Consequently, the adoption of technologies and processes that reduce water consumption could lower operating risks and costs for companies by minimizing the impact of regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions on company operations.

## Metrics

EM-IS-140a.1. (1) Total fresh water withdrawn, (2) percentage recycled, (3) percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from freshwater sources:

# Supply Chain Management

## Topic Summary

Iron ore and coal are critical raw material inputs to the steel production process. Iron ore mining and coal production are resource-intensive processes. Extraction of these materials often has substantial environmental and social externalities affecting local communities, workers, and ecosystems. Such impacts can result in disruptions to mining operations due to community protests, legal or regulatory action, or increased costs of extraction as a result of regulatory compliance costs or penalties. Iron and steel companies could face disruptions as a result, or in some cases, may also be subject to regulatory penalties associated with the environmental or social impact of the mining company supplier. In order to minimize such risks, iron and steel producers may proactively manage their direct suppliers of critical raw materials to ensure that they are not engaged in illegal or otherwise environmentally or socially damaging practices, through appropriate supplier screening, monitoring, and engagement.

## Metrics

EM-IS-430a.1. Discussion of the process for managing iron ore and/or coking coal sourcing risks arising from environmental and social issues

1 The entity shall discuss its policies and procedures for managing environmental and social risks that may affect sourcing that are present in its iron ore and/or coking coal supply chain.

# Energy Management in Manufacturing

## Topic Summary

The Building Products & Furnishings industry creates value through energy-intensive manufacturing processes. Purchased electricity represents the largest share of energy consumption across the industry, while companies may also utilize fossil fuel energy on site. The price of conventional grid electricity and volatility of fossil fuel prices may increase as a result of evolving climate change regulations and new incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy, among other factors, while alternative energy sources become more cost-competitive. Decisions regarding energy sourcing and type, as well as the use of alternative energy, can create trade-offs related to the energy supply's cost and reliability for operations. As the industry operates on relatively narrow profit margins, reductions in energy consumption may have a significant influence on financial performance. The manner in which a company manages energy efficiency, its reliance on different types of energy and the associated sustainability risks, and its ability to access alternative energy sources is likely to impact financial performance.

# Product Lifecycle Environmental Impacts

## Topic Summary

Depending on the specific building product or furnishing, significant environmental impacts can arise during raw material sourcing, transportation, manufacturing, use-phase, or end-of-life. Rising consumer and regulatory preference for less-impactful products has spawned the development of more sustainable products, broadly termed ""green building materials."" In addition, product lifecycle certification has arisen as a tool for companies and their customers to assess and improve a product's lifecycle impact. Certification programs typically address specific sustainability characteristics of a product category and include the use of closed-loop materials that help minimize a product's end-of-life environmental impacts and reduce the need for extracting or producing virgin materials. Through product innovation and design that facilitates end-of-life product recovery and the use of less-impactful materials, the adoption of product certification programs, and partnerships with customers, manufacturers of building products can achieve improvements in lifecycle impacts, reduce regulatory risk, meet growing customer demand, and realize cost savings.

# Wood Supply Chain Management

## Topic Summary

The Building Products & Furnishings industry utilizes large amounts of wood sourced from forests worldwide. Unsustainable production and harvesting of timber can result in adverse environmental and social impacts, including biodiversity loss and harm to the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities. Companies may inadvertently source wood from areas that are susceptible to unsustainable forestry practices. Reports of illegal logging, environmental pollution, or adverse impacts on communities can result in reputational repercussions that can damage a company's brand value, affecting demand for their products. In addition, regulations that address the importation of illegally produced wood can result in penalties and further damage to brand value. To mitigate these risks, companies are increasingly adopting third-party certifications that verify that wood is grown and harvested in a sustainable manner. Obtaining wood sourcing certifications can also provide companies with a potential growth channel, as they can satisfy customer demand for certified products.

# Fuel Economy & Use-phase Emissions

## Topic Summary

The combustion of petroleum-based fuels by motor vehicles accounts for a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to global climate change. It also generates local air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter (PM), which can threaten human health and the environment. In this context, vehicle emissions are increasingly of concern to consumers and regulators around the world. While use-phase emissions are downstream from auto manufacturers, regulations often focus on auto manufacturers to help reduce these emissions, such as through fuel economy standards. More stringent emissions standards and changing consumer demands are driving the expansion of markets for electric vehicles and hybrids, as well as for conventional vehicles with high fuel efficiency. Moreover, manufacturers are innovating by designing vehicles made with lighter-weight materials to improve fuel efficiency. Companies that can meet current fuel-efficiency and emissions standards and continue to innovate to meet or exceed future regulatory standards in different markets are likely to strengthen their competitive position and expand their market share, while mitigating the risk of reduced demand for conventional vehicles.

# Product Lifecycle Environmental Impacts

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Appliance Manufacturing industry are constantly seeking to differentiate their products from those of their competitors. One key differentiating factor is the environmental impact of products over their lifecycle, which is often associated with the cost of using appliances. This issue involves a company's ability to design products with the entire lifecycle in mind, from creation and use to disposal. In particular, this covers energy and water efficiency in appliances, which account for a significant proportion of a home's energy and water use, as well as designing for and facilitating safe end-of-life disposal and recycling. Companies that prioritize designing and manufacturing products with improved environmental impacts are more likely to grow consumer demand and market share.

# Industry Description

Companies in the Restaurants industry prepare meals, snacks, and beverages to customers' orders for immediate on- and off-premises consumption. Broadly divided into three sub-categories, the restaurant industry includes limited-service eating places, casual full-service eating places, and upscale full-service eating places. Limited-service restaurants provide services to customers who order and pay before eating. Fast-food restaurants represent the largest share of the limited-service restaurants segment. Full-service restaurants offer more service, food for consumption primarily on-premise, and typically reflect higher quality food and prices.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Restaurant operations have high energy intensity compared to other commercial building operations. Commercial kitchen appliances are extremely energy intensive, and dining areas are typically temperature-controlled for customers. Fossil fuel-based energy production and consumption contribute to significant environmental impacts, including climate change and air pollution, which have the potential to indirectly, yet materially, impact the results of restaurant operations. Regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing or regulatory incentives for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy affect conventional and renewable energy prices. Companies that manage energy consumption at company-owned and franchise locations can decrease operational costs through energy efficiency upgrades and limit exposure to GHG emissions regulations through the use of renewable energy resources.

## Metrics

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Water is used throughout restaurant operations, from cooking and dishwashing to cleaning. The restaurant format, size, and equipment all affect water use. Restaurants located in water-stressed regions may be exposed to water usage restrictions or face high water costs. Long-term historic increases in the costs of water, and expectations around continued increases due to overconsumption and constrained supplies resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution, and climate change, indicate the heightened importance of water management. Companies can reduce water use and associated operational costs through implementing water-efficient practices and using water-efficient commercial kitchen equipment.

# Supply Chain Management & Food Sourcing

## Topic Summary

Restaurants source ingredients and products from a wide range of suppliers. Supply chain management is crucial for restaurants to ensure food safety, protect their reputations, and improve revenues. Sourcing quality ingredients to maintain a consistent level of quality across different locations can be operationally challenging. This problem is exacerbated by the global nature of the industry. Demand from food and beverage industries, including restaurants, drives and shapes agricultural production, indicating that actions by industry players have larger impacts on society. Therefore, sustainable and ethical sourcing by industry players is necessary to ensure continued future supply and to minimize lifecycle impacts of company operations. Sourcing from suppliers that have high quality standards, employ environmentally sustainable farming methods, and honor labor rights will better position companies to protect long-term shareholder value. By increasing the amount of food supply sourced in conformance with environmental and social standards, as well as conformance with animal welfare standards and best practices, restaurant operators will be able to maintain food quality, manage food safety issues, enhance their reputation, and expand their market share.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Landfill gas is a significant anthropogenic contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because it contains highly potent methane. As a result, landfill gas is frequently required to be limited by regulators. These emissions can be reduced through a variety of control technologies that require significant capital expenditures: landfill gas collection efficiency improvements, control devices, and increased methane oxidization. Methane collected through capture systems can be combusted in a flare, an engine, or a turbine to dramatically reduce the overall toxicity and potency of raw emissions. Landfill gas capture is particularly important for owners and operators of large landfills that have been the target of regulation. Companies that operate in the waste-to-energy segment of the industry are able to lower lifecycle emissions of waste through decreased future emissions from landfills and displaced energy generation, but face increased Scope 1 emissions from the operation of waste-to-energy facilities. Overall, GHG emissions pose regulatory risks for the industry, with potential impacts on operational costs and capital expenditures. There is also the potential for revenue generation through the sale of natural gas and energy from waste-to-energy facilities, as well as the ability to lower fuel purchases by using processed landfill gas to power operations. Performance on this issue can affect a company's ability to secure new permits and/or renew existing ones, which can impact revenue.

# Fleet Fuel Management

## Topic Summary

Many companies in the Waste Management industry own and operate large vehicle fleets for waste collection and transfer. The fuel consumption of vehicle fleets is a significant industry expense, both in terms of operating costs and associated capital expenditures. Fossil fuel consumption can contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. These environmental impacts have the potential to affect waste management companies through regulatory exposure and the competitiveness of new contract proposals. Hedging fuel purchases is a common tool used to manage fleet-fuel risks; however, more and more waste management companies are upgrading to more fuel-efficient fleets or switching to natural gas vehicles. A cleaner-burning fleet may also be seen as more favorable by communities living near waste management facilities with heavy traffic.

# Industry Description

Companies in the Auto Parts industry supply motor vehicle parts and accessories to original equipment manufacturers (OEM). Auto parts companies typically specialize in the manufacturing and assembly of certain parts or accessories, such as engine exhaust systems, alternative drivetrains, hybrid systems, catalytic converters, aluminum wheels (rims), tires, rearview mirrors, and onboard electrical and electronic equipment. Although the larger automotive industry includes several tiers of suppliers that provide parts and raw materials used to assemble motor vehicles, the scope of SASB's Auto Parts industry includes only Tier 1 suppliers that supply parts directly to OEMs. The scope of the industry excludes captive suppliers, such as engine and stamping facilities, that are owned and operated by OEMs. Similarity, it excludes Tier 2 suppliers, which provide inputs for the Auto Parts industry.

#### Page 605

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Most of the energy consumed in the automobile manufacturing process happens in the supply chain. The use of electricity and fossil fuels by auto parts manufacturers in their production processes results in direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Purchased electricity represents a major share of the energy used in the Auto Parts industry. Sustainability initiatives such as incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy are making alternative sources of energy more cost-competitive. Regulators and consumers are also pressuring the industry to reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important for companies in energy-intensive industries to manage the cost and reliability risks associated with their overall energy efficiency, their reliance on different types of energy, and their access to alternative energy sources.

# Ecosystem Services & Impacts

## Topic Summary

Along with their timber output, forests provide valuable ecosystem services including carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, water purification and storage, soil formation, and recreational opportunities. Meanwhile, in many regions, regulations related to water quality and endangered species protection, as well as harvesting rights that are contingent upon environmental preservation, can create operational risks for companies. As such, protecting or enhancing ecosystem services within managed forestlands could mitigate reputational, demand, and operational risks related to the potential adverse environmental impacts of forestry. Companies increasingly utilize third-party certification to demonstrate sustainable forestry management practices that serve to enhance the value and productivity of their forest assets, as well as to meet rising customer demand for sustainably produced forest products.

# Climate Change Adaptation

## Topic Summary

Global climate change may create long-term business uncertainty for some forestry management companies. Variations in precipitation patterns and temperatures, more frequent extreme weather events and forest fires, and an increased prevalence of tree diseases and pests could adversely impact timberlands through increased mortality or diminished productivity. Conversely, climate change could also facilitate forest productivity through increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, a longer growing season, moderating temperatures in high latitudes, greater precipitation, and expanded geographic ranges for some species, positively impacting forest productivity. In light of such variability, companies could benefit from identifying and understanding potential long-term impacts of climate change on the productivity of forestlands, and adjusting forestry management strategies to optimize the productivity of their forestland assets.

# Raw Materials Sourcing

## Topic Summary

The Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry relies on numerous raw materials as key inputs for finished products, including cotton, leather, wool, rubber, and precious minerals and metals. Sustainability impacts related to climate change, land use, resource scarcity, and conflict in regions where the industry's supply chain operates are increasingly shaping the industry's ability to source materials. The ability of companies to manage potential materials shortages, supply disruptions, price volatility, and reputational risks is made more difficult by the fact that they source materials from geographically diverse regions through supply chains that often lack transparency. Failure to effectively manage this issue can lead to reduced margins, constrained revenue growth, and/or higher costs capital. The types of risk associated with sourcing different materials can require different solutions, including engaging with suppliers, enhancing transparency, using certification standards, and/or using innovative alternative materials. Companies that are most proactive are likely to reduce their exposure to price volatility and potential supply disruptions, while improving their brand reputation and developing new market opportunities.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

The manufacturing of pulp and paper products generates direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass in stationary and mobile engines, cogeneration boilers, and other processing equipment. Companies in this industry also typically use significant amounts of carbon-neutral biomass for their energy needs, the use of which can reduce the costs associated with purchasing fossil fuels, as well as mitigate regulatory risk associated with carbon emissions. Emissions associated with fossil fuel sources can create regulatory compliance costs, depending on the magnitude of emissions and the prevailing emissions regulations. Companies that cost-effectively manage GHG emissions through greater energy efficiency, the use of alternative fuels, or manufacturing process improvements can benefit from improved operating efficiency and reduced regulatory compliance costs.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Pulp and paper products manufacturing is energy-intensive. In most facilities, energy is derived primarily from the combustion of biomass and fossil fuels, while purchased electricity may also be used in some facilities. Decisions regarding the generation of electricity on-site versus sourcing it from the grid, as well as the use of biomass and other renewable energy, can create trade-offs related to the energy supply's cost and reliability for operations and the extent of the regulatory risk from Scope 1 or other air emissions. The manner in which a company manages its energy efficiency, its reliance on different types of energy and the associated sustainability risks, and its ability to access alternative energy sources is likely to mitigate impacts of energy cost variability.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Pulp and paper products manufacturing is typically a water-intensive process, with water use occurring during in materials processing, process cooling, and steam generation at on-site energy plants. Companies require ample, stable water supplies and may produce large volumes of wastewater, the majority of which is treated and returned to the environment. Process water typically contains dissolved organic compounds and other solids, underscoring the importance of water treatment. In addition to water effluents, water availability is an important consideration for the industry, as water scarcity could result in higher supply costs, supply disruptions, or tension with local water users. Companies can adopt various strategies to address water supply and treatment issues, such as cost-effectively enhancing the recycling of process water, improving production techniques to lower water intensity, and ensuring compliance with water-effluent regulations.

# Supply Chain Management

## Topic Summary

Pulp and paper products companies source wood and wood fiber from forestry management companies, paper fiber recyclers, and forests that the companies themselves manage. Supply-chain risks include decreased productivity of forestlands due to management practices or climate change, regulations addressing sustainable forest management, and reputational impacts. To mitigate such risks and satisfy growing customer demand for sustainably sourced fiber and paper products, manufacturers implement forest certification and fiber chain-of-custody standards which verify that virgin and recycled fiber originate from sustainably managed forests. In addition, pulp and paper manufacturers face trade-offs from the use of recovered fiber. Products with recycled content are increasingly in demand , providing a possible avenue for product differentiation, while using recycled fiber can minimize the need for virgin fiber. Conversely, manufacturing products with a greater recycled content can increase waste generation and energy consumption, while recycled fiber can be costlier, given demand-supply gaps. Therefore, companies can benefit by optimizing recycled fiber use to balance its environmental and economic trade-offs.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

With many facilities open 24 hours a day, the Casinos & Gaming industry requires a large amount of energy to operate. Casino facilities often have few windows and therefore rely on their buildings' mechanical systems for heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (HVAC), and lighting. Fossil fuel-based energy production and consumption contribute to significant environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution, and have the potential to impact casino companies' results of operations. It is becoming increasingly important for companies that rely on electricity consumption for their operations to manage energy efficiency as well as energy availability, including the risks and opportunities associated with energy sourcing from fossil fuels and/or from renewable and alternative energy sources.

# Industry Description

The Biofuels industry consists of companies that produce biofuels and process raw materials for production. Biofuels are manufactured using organic feedstocks and are used primarily as transportation fuels. Companies typically source feedstocks, which include food, oil crops, and animal products, from agricultural product distributors. Ethanol and biodiesel are the most widely produced biofuels, while other types include biogas, biohydrogen, and synthetic biofuels, produced from a variety of organic feedstocks. Biofuels companies' customers are chiefly fuel-blending and fuel-supply companies, including major integrated oil companies. While biofuels are produced worldwide, the publicly listed companies in the biofuels industry operate primarily in the U.S., though some have minor operations abroad, notably in India, Brazil, and South Korea. Government regulations related to the use of renewable fuel are a significant demand driver in the industry.

#### Page 427

# Water Management in Manufacturing

## Topic Summary

Biofuel refining is typically water-intensive. Biorefineries require water for feedstock processing, fermentation, distillation, and cooling. Although water use at biorefineries is modest relative to the quantities consumed during feedstock crop production, it is concentrated, and thus may have impacts on local water resources. Facilities may also generate wastewater containing salts, organic compounds, dissolved solids, phosphorus, and other substances, requiring wastewater treatment. Biofuel refineries may also be exposed to the risk of reduced water availability and related cost increases or operational disruption. Extraction of water from certain areas for the purposes of refining, as well as contamination of water supplies due to refining operations, could also create regulatory risk and tensions with local communities. Water efficiency in operations and the proper treatment of effluents are therefore important factors for the performance of biofuels companies.

# Lifecycle Emissions Balance

## Topic Summary

The rapid growth in global biofuels production is due in large part to government energy policies that seek to reduce net GHG emissions from transportation fuels and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Most major renewable-fuel policies worldwide require that biofuels achieve lifecycle GHG emissions reductions relative to a fossil-fuel baseline to qualify for renewable fuel-mandate thresholds. The biofuel lifecycle emission calculation can include indirect and direct emissions from feedstock crop production and land use, fuel refining, fuel and feedstock transport, and vehicle exhaust emissions. Biofuel producers can directly influence net emissions during the refining process through energy management (fuel use), process innovations, and by using feedstocks with lower emissions profiles. Fuel products that achieve a reduction in net emissions can qualify as advanced biofuels, which, based on existing biofuels mandates in the U.S. and Europe, may be subject to increased demand in the future. Biofuel companies that cost-effectively reduce the net carbon emissions of their products may gain a competitive product advantage, leading to revenue growth and increased market share.

# Sourcing & Environmental Impacts of Feedstock Production

## Topic Summary

The Biofuels industry utilizes a variety of plant-based feedstocks as raw materials for production. Most companies purchase feedstocks from agricultural producers and distributors. A growing proportion of the world's arable land is now occupied by biofuel crops. Unsustainable cultivation practices can have negative environmental externalities, including deforestation and biodiversity loss, soil degradation, and water pollution. These factors could adversely affect feedstock crop yields over the short- and long-term. This, in turn, could influence the price and availability of feedstocks for biofuels producers. Consequently, vetting the sustainability of supply chains, such as through certifications or engagement with suppliers, is an important consideration for biofuels producers.

## Metrics

RR-BI-430a.1. Discussion of strategy to manage risks associated with environmental impacts of feedstock production

1. The entity shall discuss its strategy to manage the environmental impacts and regulatory risks associated with feedstock production, where risks may include, but are not limited to:

   1.1 Risks to feedstock supply and pricing created by climate change impacts such as increased likelihood of extreme weather events, decreased availability of clean water resources, increased competition for arable land, and decreased crop yields due to temperature increases.

   1.2 Long-term risks to feedstock supply associated with suppliers' impacts on environmental health including those on biodiversity and soil health that may be due to monoculture practices and/or fertilizer and pesticide use.

   1.3 Constraints created by regulation such as compliance with sustainability criteria in renewable fuel mandates (including RFS2 in the U.S. and the Renewable Energy Directive in the EU); potential regulatory limits on the types of land where feedstock can be grown; potential limits on what qualifies as renewable biomass; potential for reduction or loss of public or political support for biofuel mandates due to environmental impacts of feedstock production; and resistance to the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

2. The scope of this disclosure excludes risks associated with the lifecycle GHG emissions, which are addressed in RR-BI-410a.1, respectively.

3. If the entity identifies availability of clean water resources as a risk to feedstock supply and/or pricing, it shall discuss its vulnerability to feedstock growing regions with water stress and how it manages the risk of price variability due to sourcing feedstock from these regions.

   3.1 The entity should identify its known sources of feedstock from growing regions with High (40—80 percent) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress using the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.

#### Page 434

4 The entity shall describe its approach to managing risks and/or opportunities associated with feedstock production, including constraints created by regulation, and limits on availability and price.

4.1 Relevant strategies to discuss include sourcing from feedstock producers that are third-party certified to environmental sustainability standards, diversification of suppliers, using feedstock procurement criteria to choose suppliers for varied feedstocks with fewer environmental impacts or greater adaptability to the effects of environmental externalities (e.g., drought-tolerant or disease-resistant feedstocks), supplier audits, sourcing from regions where the entity has greater control over feedstock sources, and expenditures on research and development (R&D) for alternative and substitute feedstocks that are less susceptible to environmental externalities.

4.2 The entity should disclose the sustainability criteria it uses to assess its feedstock suppliers.

RR-BI-430a.2. Percentage of biofuel production third-party certified to an environmental sustainability standard

2.1 At a minimum, standards should include the following environmental sustainability topics:

2.1.1 GHG and other air emissions, water consumption and quality, soil health, fertilizer and pesticide use, land-use change, biodiversity, and waste management.

3 The entity should disclose the certification schemes to which its biofuel is certified and the percentage of production certified to each scheme.

#### Page 435

# Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment

## Topic Summary

The Biofuels industry is highly dependent on government policies and regulations, which create market demand and incentivize supply with tax breaks and other support for feedstock production. The Biofuels industry therefore supports certain regulations and policies related to renewable fuel policy, production tax credits, and feedstock production. While regulatory support can result in positive short-term gains by supporting the biofuels market, the potential long-term adverse environmental impacts from feedstock and biofuels production may result in a reversal of beneficial policies, leading to a more uncertain regulatory environment. Consequently, biofuels companies could benefit from developing a clear strategy for engaging regulators that is aligned with long-term sustainable business outcomes and that accounts for environmental externalities.

# Industry Description

The Telecommunication Services industry consists of wireless and wireline telecommunications companies, as well as companies that provide cable and satellite services. The wireless services segment provides direct communication through radio-based cellular networks and operates and maintains the associated switching and transmission facilities. The wireline segment provides local and long distance voice communication via the Public Switched Telephone Network. Wireline carriers also offer voice over internet protocol (VoIP) telephone, television, and broadband internet services over an expanding network of fiber optic cables. Cable providers distribute television programming from cable networks to subscribers. They typically also provide consumers with video services, high-speed internet service, and VoIP. These services are traditionally bundled into packages that provide subscribers with easier payment options than paying for each service separately. Satellite companies distribute TV programming through broadcasting satellites orbiting the Earth or through ground stations. Companies serve customers primarily in their domestic markets, although some companies operate in several countries.

# Environmental Footprint of Operations

## Topic Summary

Individual telecommunication services companies consume substantial amounts of energy. Depending on the source of energy and the efficiency of its generation, electricity consumption by telecom network infrastructure can contribute significantly to environmental externalities, such as climate change, creating sustainability risks for the industry. Although network equipment and data centers are becoming more energy-efficient, their overall energy consumption is increasing with the expansion in telecommunications infrastructure and data traffic. The way in which telecommunication services companies manage their overall energy efficiency or intensity, their reliance on different types of energy, and their ability to access alternative sources of energy will become increasingly material as the global regulatory focus on climate change increases, bringing with it incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy as well as pricing of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Since expenditures on energy can be significant in the industry, companies that are able to improve the energy-efficiency of their operation are likely to see cost savings and higher profit margins.

## Metrics

# Managing Systemic Risks from Technology Disruptions

## Topic Summary

Given the systemic importance of telecommunications networks, systemic or economy-wide disruption may be created if the network infrastructure of telecommunication services companies is unreliable and prone to business continuity risks. As the frequency of extreme weather events associated with climate change increases, telecommunication services companies will face growing physical threats to network infrastructure, with potentially significant social or systemic impacts. In the absence of resilient and reliable infrastructure, companies may face lost revenue associated with service outages and unplanned capital expenditures to repair damaged or compromised equipment. Companies that successfully implement measures to address business continuity risks, including an identification of critical business operations, or to enhance resilience of the system are likely to substantially reduce their risk exposure and, hence, lower their cost of capital. While implementation of such measures may have upfront costs, companies are likely to see long-term benefits in terms of lower remediation expenses in cases of high-impact disruptions.

## Metrics

TC-TL-550a.2. Discussion of systems to provide unimpeded service during service interruptions

1    The entity shall discuss business continuity risks associated with technology disruptions affecting operations.

1.1  Examples of disruptions include, but are not limited to, those caused by technical failures, programming errors, cyber attacks, weather events, or natural disasters at hosting facilities. .

2    The entity shall discuss measures to address business continuity risks, including an identification of critical business operations and redundancies or other measures implemented to enhance resilience of the system or to reduce impact, including insurance against loss.

3    The entity may discuss estimated amount of potential loss, probability of that loss, and the associated timeframe. These estimates may be based on insurance figures or other third-party or internal assessments of potential loss.

# Industry Description

The Hotels & Lodging industry is composed of companies that provide overnight accommodation, including hotels, motels, and inns. It is a competitive industry that is primarily comprised of large hotel chains and in which customers base purchase decisions on a wide range of factors including quality and consistency of services, availability of locations, price, and loyalty program offers. Businesses are often structured in one or more of the following ways: direct revenue from hotel services, including room rental and food and beverage sales; management and franchise services with fee revenue from property management; and vacation residential ownership with revenue from sales of residential units.

Note: Select companies in the Hotels & Lodging industry are also engaged in activities of the Restaurants industry. The SASB standards for such activities are outlined in the Restaurants industry standards. For the purposes of this standard, it is assumed that hotels and lodging companies do not provide food and beverage services, and therefore issues such as food safety, waste, and sourcing, which may be material for companies that offer food and beverages, are not covered by this industry standard.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Hotel buildings require a significant amount of energy resources to operate, which represent a substantial portion of hotel operating expenses. The majority of the industry's electricity usage is commercially purchased. This purchased electricity indirectly leads to the release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which is a large contributor to climate change. Companies in the industry are implementing energy management best practices in order to reduce operating expenses and environmental impacts and to improve their reputations with guests, who are increasingly concerned about environmental sustainability.

#### Page 541

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Hotel buildings require a relatively large amount of water resources to operate. While water is not the industry's greatest operating cost, reduced water availability or significant price increases could impact financial results. This impact may be particularly acute in water-stressed region due to supply constraints. Companies in the industry are implementing water management best practices in order to reduce operating expenses and environmental impacts and improve to their reputations with guests, who are increasingly concerned about environmental sustainability.

## Metrics

SV-HL-140a.1. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources.

1.1 Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities.

2 The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources.

2.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.

2.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.

3 The entity shall disclose the total amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.

# Climate Change Adaptation

## Topic Summary

Hotels operating in climate change-exposed areas may be impacted by physical climate risks including inclement weather and flooding. Inclement weather may damage property and disrupt operations, thereby reducing asset values and revenues. In addition, hotels may face higher insurance premiums for buildings located in coastal regions or may be unable to insure their properties. Hotel operators will likely need to adapt to shifting climate trends such as rising sea levels, hurricanes, and flooding in order to maintain their climate-exposed revenue-generating properties.

## Metrics

# Industry Description

The Real Estate industry is composed of companies that own, develop, and generally operate income-producing real estate assets. Companies in this industry are commonly structured as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and operate in a wide range of segments within the real estate industry, including residential, retail, office, health care, industrial, and hotel properties. REITs typically focus on the direct ownership of real estate assets, thereby providing investors with the opportunity to obtain real estate exposure without direct asset ownership and management. Although REITs are often concentrated in one segment of the Real Estate industry, many REITs are diversified through investment in multiple property types.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Real estate assets consume significant amounts of energy, primarily related to space heating, ventilating, air conditioning, water heating, lighting, and the use of equipment and appliances. The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and strategies for energy management are highly dependent on the real estate asset class, among other factors. Generally, grid electricity consumption is the predominant form of consumed energy, though on-site fuel combustion and renewable energy production also serve an important roles. Energy costs may be borne by companies in the industry and/or the property occupants; either way, energy management is a significant industry issue. To the extent that the real estate owner assumes direct responsibility for energy costs, such costs often represent significant operating costs, inherently indicating the importance of energy management. Energy pricing volatility and a general trend of electricity price increases, energy-related regulations, wide variations in energy performance across the existing building stock, and opportunities for efficiency improvements through economically attractive capital investments all further point to the importance of energy management. Energy costs assumed by occupants, either in whole or in part, are nonetheless likely to significantly impact companies in the industry, albeit through differing channels. Building energy performance is a notable driver of tenant demand, as it allows them to control operating costs, mitigate the environmental impacts of operations, and, often just as importantly, maintain a reputation for resource conservation. Additionally, real estate owners may be exposed to energy-related regulations even when energy costs are the responsibility of occupants. Overall, companies in the industry that effectively manage the energy performance of their assets may see reduced operating costs and regulatory risks, as well as increased tenant demand, rental rates, and occupancy rates—all of which drive revenue and asset value appreciation. Improving the energy performance of assets is highly dependent on property type and location, target tenant market, local building codes, physical and legal opportunities to deploy distributed renewable energy, ability to measure consumption, and performance of existing building stock, among other factors.

#### Page 361

1.1.2 Number of units may be used in place of floor area in the Apartments and Lodging/Resorts property subsectors.

1.2 Floor area is considered to have complete energy consumption data coverage when energy consumption data (i.e., energy types and amounts consumed) is obtained by the entity for all types of energy consumed in the relevant floor area during the reporting period, regardless of when such data was obtained.

1.2.1 If such data is not available for one or more types of energy consumed, the relevant floor area shall not be considered to have complete energy consumption data coverage.

1.3 The percentage shall be calculated as the portfolio gross floor area with complete energy consumption data coverage divided by the total portfolio gross floor area for which energy is used.

5.5    Purchased by Tenant is defined as ""Energy purchased by the tenant. Typically this is data that is not within the participants' immediate control.""

5.6    Managed Assets and Indirectly Managed Assets are defined as follows: ""This definition of Managed assets and the definition of Indirectly Managed assets are solely based on the landlord/tenant relationship. [Managed and Indirectly Managed Assets are] assets or buildings for which the landlord is determined to have 'operational control' where operational control is defined as having the ability to introduce and implement operating and/or environmental policies and measures. In case both the landlord and tenant have the authority to introduce and implement any or

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Buildings consume significant amounts of water in their operations, through water fixtures, building equipment, appliances, and irrigation. Operating costs resulting from water consumption may represent significant costs depending on property type, tenant operations, geographical locations, and other factors. Companies in the industry can be responsible for a building's water costs, or common area water costs, though it is common to allocate all, or a portion, of these costs to occupants. In these arrangements, water management continues to play an important role through tenant demand and regulatory exposure. Tenants may assess the water efficiency of real estate assets in an effort to control operating costs, mitigate environmental impacts of operations, and, often just as importantly, develop a reputation for resource conservation. Additionally, real estate owners may be exposed to water-related regulations even when water costs are the responsibility of occupants. Overall, companies in the industry that effectively manage water efficiency of assets, even when they don't face direct exposure to water costs, may see reduced operating costs and regulatory exposure, as well as increased tenant demand, rental rates, and occupancy rates—all of which drive revenue and asset value appreciation. Long-term historic increases in the costs of water—and expectations of continued increases due to overconsumption and constrained supplies resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution, and climate change—indicate the heightened importance of water management. The ability to improve asset water efficiency is highly dependent on the property type, locational water availability, target tenant market, local building codes, the ability to measure consumption, and the level of current efficiency of existing building stock, among other factors.

# Management of Tenant Sustainability Impacts

## Topic Summary

Real estate assets generate significant sustainability impacts, including resource consumption—namely energy and water—waste generation, and impacts on occupant health through indoor environmental quality. While companies in the industry own real estate assets, it is the tenant operations of such assets that is a dominant driver of sustainability impacts produced by the built environment. Tenants may design and construct leased spaces according to their operating needs. In turn, their operations consume significant amounts of energy and water, generate waste, and impact the health of those living, working, shopping, or visiting the properties. While these sustainability impacts are often generated by tenant operations and activities, real estate owners have an important role in influencing tenant sustainability impacts. The manner in which companies in the industry structure their agreements, contracts, and relationships with tenants is instrumental in effectively managing the sustainability impacts of their tenants, and ultimately, the impacts of their assets. Managing tenant sustainability impacts may include mitigating the problem of split incentives by aligning both parties' financial interests with sustainability outcomes, establishing systematic measurement and communication of resource consumption data, creating shared performance goals, and mandating minimum sustainability performance or design requirements, among other strategies. Effective management of tenant sustainability impacts, particularly related to energy, water, and indoor environmental quality, may drive asset value appreciation, increase tenant demand and satisfaction, decrease direct operating costs, and/or decrease risks related to building codes and regulations.

# Climate Change Adaptation

## Topic Summary

Climate change affects companies in the industry via frequent or high-impact extreme weather events and changing climate patterns. The manner in which a company's business model is structured to incorporate ongoing assessments of climate change risks, and the adaptation to such risks, is likely to be increasingly connected to company value over the long term. More specifically, investment strategies with assets located on floodplains and in coastal regions that are exposed to inclement weather may have increased needs around risk mitigation and business model adaptation to climate change over the long term. These strategies are especially important in light of the long-term challenges associated with flood insurance rates, the financial stability of government-subsidized flood insurance programs, and financing stipulations or other creditor concerns. Besides insurance, other risk mitigation measures include improvements to physical asset resiliency and lease terms that transfer risk to tenants, although these measures can create their own costs and risks for real estate companies. To ensure long-term growth and protection of shareholder value, companies need to implement climate change adaptation strategies that are comprehensive, account for trade-offs between various risk mitigation strategies, and integrate consideration of all projected costs and benefits over the long term.

## Industry Description

The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry produces raw and processed animal products, including meats, eggs, and dairy products, for human and animal consumption. Key activities include animal raising, slaughtering, processing, and packaging. The industry's largest companies have international operations, and companies are vertically integrated to varying degrees, depending on the type of animal produced. Large industry operators typically rely on contract or independent farmers to supply their animals, and may have varying degrees of control over their operations. The industry sells products primarily to the Processed Foods industry and to retail distributors that distribute finished products to key end markets including restaurants, livestock and pet feed consumers, and grocery retailers.

#### Page 229

29 Note to FB-MP-000.B – Categories of animal protein production may be based on animal (e.g., chicken, pork, beef) and/or product type (e.g., milk, shell eggs). Units of measure shall be appropriate to the animal or product category (e.g., metric tons, number/head, gallons).

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry generates significant Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both livestock and energy-intensive industrial processes. GHG emissions contribute to climate change and create additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for meat, poultry, and dairy companies due to climate change mitigation policies. The majority of the industry's emissions stem directly from the animals themselves through the release of methane during enteric fermentation, and from manure storage and processing. The direct emissions from raising and producing livestock represent a significant portion of total GHG emissions released among all sources. These emissions sources are currently not widely regulated, which presents uncertainties as to the future of GHG regulations for the industry. Companies in this industry also use large quantities of fossil fuels to meet energy needs, generating additional direct GHG emissions and increasing exposure to regulatory risks. Future emission regulations could result in additional operating and/or compliance costs. By implementing new technologies to capture animal emissions and focusing on energy efficiency, companies can mitigate regulatory risk and volatile energy costs while also limiting their GHG emissions.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry relies heavily on purchased electricity and fuel as critical inputs for value creation. Companies' use of electricity and fossil fuels in their operations results in direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. Purchased electricity is a significant operating cost for meat, poultry, and dairy companies. Efficient energy usage is essential to maintain a competitive advantage in this industry, as purchased fuels and electricity account for a significant portion of total production costs. Decisions regarding the use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site generation of electricity versus purchasing from the grid can play an important role in influencing both the costs and the reliability of the energy supply.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry is water-intensive both in raising livestock and industrial processing. Additionally, companies in the industry typically generate wastewater, or effluent, from both animal production and processing activities. As water scarcity becomes an issue of growing importance due to population growth, increasing consumption per capita, poor water management, and climate change, companies in the industry may face higher operational costs or lost revenues due to water shortages and/or regulations resulting in production reduction. Companies can manage water-related risks and opportunities through capital investments and assessment of facility locations relative to water scarcity risks, improvements to operational efficiency, and partnerships with regulators and communities on issues related to water access and effluent.

# Land Use & Ecological Impacts

## Topic Summary

Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry operations have diverse ecological impacts, primarily because of significant land-use needs to raise livestock and the contamination of the air, land, and groundwater by animal waste. While the impacts are different, both traditional and Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO) lead to significant ecological impacts. The primary concern from CAFOs and animal-product processing facilities is the generation of large and concentrated amounts of waste and pollutants into the environment. Treating effluent and waste from facilities involves significant costs. Non-CAFO animal farming, which requires large tracts of pastureland, can lead to physical degradation of land resources. Land use and ecological impacts pose legal and regulatory risks in the form of fines, litigation, and difficulties obtaining permits for facility expansions or waste discharges.

# Animal & Feed Sourcing

## Topic Summary

Meat, poultry, and dairy companies source animal and animal feed from a range of suppliers depending on animal species. The industry's ability to reliably source animals and animal feed at desired price points may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management, and other resource scarcity considerations. Companies that select and work with suppliers who are less resource-intensive and who actively manage adaptation to climate change and other resource scarcity risks, will be better protected from potential price volatility and supply disruptions. Additionally, such companies may improve their brand reputation and develop new market opportunities. Failure to effectively manage sourcing risks can lead to higher costs of capital, reduced margins, and constrained revenue growth.

# Industry Description

Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing (R&M) companies refine petroleum products, market oil and gas products, and/ or operate gas stations and convenience stores, all of which comprise the downstream operations of the oil and gas value chain. The types of refinery products and crude oil inputs influence the complexity of the refining process used, with different expenditure needs and intensity of environmental and social impacts.

Note: The standards discussed below are for ""pure-play"" R&M activities, or independent R&M companies. Integrated oil and gas companies conduct upstream operations and are also involved in the distribution and/or refining or marketing of products. SASB has separate standards for the Oil and Gas Exploration & Production (EM-EP), and Midstream (EM-MD) industries. As such, integrated companies should also consider the disclosure topics and metrics from these standards.

15 Note to EM-RM-000.A – The total volume of crude oil and other feedstocks processed in the refinery system during the reporting period.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Oil and Gas R&M operations generate significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, from a variety of sources. Emissions primarily consist of carbon dioxide and methane from the stationary combustion of fossil fuels for energy consumption. Energy costs are a significant share of refinery operating costs. Greenhouse gases are also released from process emissions, fugitive emissions resulting from leaks, emissions from venting and flaring, and from non-routine events such as equipment maintenance. The energy intensity of production, and therefore the GHG emissions intensity, can vary significantly depending on the type of crude oil feedstock used and refined product specifications. Companies that cost-effectively reduce GHG emissions from their operations can create operational efficiencies. Such reduction can also mitigate the impact on value of increased fuel costs from regulations that seek to limit—or put a put a price on—GHG emissions.

## Metrics

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Refineries can use relatively large quantities of water depending on their size and the complexity of the refining process. This exposes them to the risk of reduced water availability, depending on their location, and related costs. Extraction of water from water-stressed regions or water contamination may also create tensions with local communities. Refinery operations often require wastewater treatment and disposal, often via on-site wastewater treatment plants before discharge. Reducing water use and contamination through recycling and other water management strategies may result in operational efficiencies for companies and lower their operating costs. They could also minimize the impacts of regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions on operations.

## Metrics

EM-RM-140a.1. (1) Total fresh water withdrawn, (2) percentage recycled, (3) percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

1. The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from freshwater sources:

   1.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local statutes and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no regulatory definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1000 parts per million of dissolved solids.

   1.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.

2. The entity shall disclose the percentage of water recycled as the volume, in thousands of cubic meters, recycled divided by the volume of water withdrawn.

   2.1 Any volume of water reused multiple times shall be counted as recycled each time it is recycled and reused.

3. The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40-80%) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.

4. The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn.

5. The entity shall disclose its water consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water consumed.

# Product Specifications & Clean Fuel Blends

## Topic Summary

Human health risks and broad environmental risks such as those associated with climate change have raised concerns about the end use of products such as gasoline from the Refining & Marketing (R&M) industry. In response, some regulatory jurisdictions have implemented product specifications and renewable fuel blends, which pose significant compliance and operational risks for R&M companies. Companies may face long-term reductions in revenue from fossil fuel-based products and services due to GHG mitigation policies such as the renewable fuel mandates or standards, as well as competition from non-fossil fuel products. Companies that purchase credits known as renewable identification numbers (RINs) to meet regulatory requirements for renewable fuels in the U.S. can face regulatory and cost risks. In order to ensure regulatory compliance and position themselves for long-term competitiveness, some companies are investing in or purchasing ethanol and other renewable biofuels. Advanced biofuels and fuel technologies have lower lifecycle impacts than traditional biofuels, and can be used to minimize future regulatory risks and public pressure. Although short-term costs to find commercially viable technologies can be significant, investments in R&D for such technologies could serve to advance R&M companies' long-term profitability.

## Metrics

EM-RM-410a.2. Total addressable market and share of market for advanced biofuels and associated infrastructure

1    The entity shall provide an estimation of the total addressable market for advanced biofuels and associated infrastructure.

1.1    Total addressable market is defined as potential revenue should the entity capture 100 percent of the market share of the product category (e.g., the global market for advanced biofuels and advanced biofuel infrastructure).

2    The entity shall disclose the share of the total addressable market for advanced biofuels and/or associated infrastructure that it currently captures with its products.

2.1    Market share shall be calculated as revenues from these products divided by the size of the total addressable market.

3    Advanced biofuels are defined as biofuels other than ethanol derived from corn starch (kernels) and having 50% lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions relative to gasoline.

4    Revenue from advanced biofuel infrastructure includes that from the entity's retail operations (i.e., fuel stations), joint ventures with primary producers, or technologies that enable the production of advanced biofuels.

5    If there is a significant difference between the total addressable market and the market that the entity can serve through its existing or planned capabilities, sales channels, or products (i.e., the serviceable available market) then the entity may disclose this information.

#### Page 123

6 The entity may provide a projection of growth of this market, where the projected addressable market is represented—based on a reasonable set of assumptions about changes in market conditions— as a percentage of year-on-year growth or as an estimate of the market size after a defined period (i.e., the market size in 10 years).

6.1 The entity may disclose its target three-year market share as a measurement of targeted growth, where the target is the percentage of the total addressable market that the entity plans to address over a three-year time horizon.

7 The entity may discuss other non-revenue generating initiatives it has undertaken to commercialize biofuels, such as partnerships (e.g., pilot projects, research and development projects) with fleet operators (air, ground, or marine transportation), airlines, vehicle manufacturers, and governmental agencies.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Semiconductors industry generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly those from perfluorinated compounds, from semiconductor manufacturing operations. GHG emissions can create regulatory compliance costs and operating risks for semiconductors companies, although resulting financial impacts will vary depending on the magnitude of emissions and the prevailing emissions regulations.

# Energy Management in Manufacturing

## Topic Summary

Energy is a critical input for manufacturing semiconductor devices. The price of conventional grid electricity and volatility of fossil fuel prices may increase as a result of evolving climate change regulations and new incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy, among other factors, while alternative energy sources become more cost-competitive. Decisions regarding energy sourcing and type, as well as the use of alternative energy, can create trade-offs related to the energy supply's cost and reliability for operations. As industry innovation adds complexity to manufacturing processes, new technologies to manufacture semiconductors are likely to consume more energy unless companies invest in the energy efficiency of their operations. The manner in which a company manages energy efficiency, its reliance on different types of energy and the associated sustainability risks, and its ability to access alternative energy sources is likely to impact financial performance.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Water is critical to the semiconductor production process, which requires significant volumes of ""ultra-pure"" water for cleaning purposes, to avoid trace molecules from affecting product quality. As manufacturing becomes more complex, companies in the industry are finding it important to reduce the use of ultra-pure water. Water is becoming a scarce resource around the world, due to increasing consumption from population growth and rapid urbanization, and reduced supplies due to climate change. Furthermore, water pollution in developing countries makes available water supplies unusable or expensive to treat. Without careful planning, water scarcity can result in higher supply costs, social tensions with local communities and governments, and/or loss of access to water in water-scarce regions thereby presenting a critical risk to production. Semiconductor companies that are able to increase the efficiency of water use during manufacturing will maintain a lower risk profile and face lower regulatory risks as local, regional, and national environmental laws place increasing emphasis on resource conservation.

# Product Lifecycle Management

## Topic Summary

As an increasing number of devices become connected to each other and to the Internet, semiconductor companies face greater demand for products that will enable higher computing power and lower energy costs. Semiconductor machinery and device manufacturers can reduce the environmental and human health impacts of their products by increasing the energy-efficiency of equipment and chips and reducing the amount of harmful materials in products. As consumer demand grows for energy-efficient devices that enable a longer battery life, reduce heat output, and allow end users to lower energy bills, semiconductor manufacturers that meet this need can gain a competitive advantage, driving revenues and market share growth. Companies can also benefit from working to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of toxic materials from chips destined for consumer devices, which has implications for the end-of-life management of electronic waste, an issue of growing legislative importance in many countries.

# Industry Description

Companies in this industry rent or lease passenger vehicles to customers. Car rentals are typically for periods of less than a month, while leases are for a year or more. The industry includes car-sharing business models where rentals are measured hourly and typically include subscription fees. Car rental companies operate out of airport locations, which serve business and leisure travelers, and out of neighborhood locations, which mostly provide repair-shop and weekend rentals. The industry is concentrated, with several dominant market players, who operate globally using a franchise model. The growth of public transit and ride-sharing services in major metropolitan areas may represent a threat to the long-term profitability of the Car Rental & Leasing industry if customers chose to hail rides or take public transit rather than rent vehicles.

# Fleet Fuel Management

## Topic Summary

Non-alcoholic beverages companies generate direct Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from large vehicle fleets for distribution and from manufacturing facilities. Specifically, refrigeration used in manufacturing facilities and in transport vehicles contributes to a large portion of overall emissions for the industry. Efficiencies gained in fuel use can reduce costs, mitigate exposure to fossil fuel price volatility, and limit emissions from production, storage, and transportation of products. Short-term capital expenditures in fuel efficient fleets and more energy-efficient technologies may be outweighed by long-term operational savings and mitigation of regulatory risk.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Non-Alcoholic Beverages industry use significant energy to operate manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and warehouses. Companies in the industry generally purchase electricity from the grid. Energy generation contributes to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution, which have the potential to indirectly, yet materially, impact the operations of non-alcoholic beverages companies. Companies can reduce energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their operations by implementing more efficient technologies and processes. Decisions regarding the use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site generation of electricity versus purchasing from the grid, can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of the energy supply.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Water management relates to a company's direct water usage, the exposure of its operations to water-stressed regions, and its management of wastewater. Companies in the Non-Alcoholic Beverages industry use a large amount of water in their operations, as water is a key input to finished products. Given non-alcoholic beverage companies' heavy reliance on large volumes of clean water and the fact that water stress is increasing in different regions globally, companies may be exposed to supply disruptions that could significantly impact operations and add to costs. Companies operating in water-stressed regions that fail to address local water concerns may face further risk of losing their social license to operate. Additionally, proper wastewater treatment is an important element of managing water issues in operations, because bottling plants release large quantities of effluents. Improving water management through increased efficiency, recycling, and proper disposal, particularly in regions with baseline water stress, can lead to lower operating costs, reduced risks, and higher intangible asset value.

# Environmental & Social Impacts of Ingredient Supply Chain

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Non-Alcoholic Beverages industry manage global supply chains to source a wide range of ingredient inputs. How companies screen, monitor, and engage with suppliers on environmental and social topics affects the ability of companies to secure supply and manage price fluctuations. Supply chain interruption can cause loss of revenue and negatively impact market share if companies are not able to find alternatives for key suppliers or have to source ingredients at higher cost. Supply chain management issues related to labor practices, environmental responsibility, ethics, or corruption may also result in regulatory fines and/or increased long-term operational costs for companies. The consumer-facing nature of the industry increases the reputational risks associated with supplier actions Managing a company's exposure to environmental and social risks can lead to improved supply chain resiliency and enhanced reputation, which provide value to shareholders. Companies can engage with key suppliers to manage environmental and social risks to improve supply chain resiliency, mitigate reputational risks, and potentially increase consumer demand or capture new market opportunities.

# Ingredient Sourcing

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Non-Alcoholic Beverages industry source a wide range of ingredients from suppliers worldwide. The industry's ability to source ingredients and at certain price points fluctuates with supply availability, which may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management, and other resource scarcity considerations. This exposure can lead to price volatility which may affect company profitability. Ultimately, climate change, water scarcity, and land-use restrictions present risks to a company's long-term ability to source key materials and ingredients. Companies that source ingredients which are more productive and less resource-intensive, or work closely with suppliers to increase their adaptability to climate change and other resource scarcity risks will be better protected from price volatility and/or supply disruptions.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Air Freight & Logistics industry generate direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change. Emissions are generated from fuel combustion by both air and road freight operations. Given the altitude of the emissions from jet fuel, air freight makes an especially potent contribution to climate change. Management of GHG emissions is likely to affect air freight and logistics companies' cost structure over time, as emissions are tied directly to fuel use, and thus to operating expenses. Fuel efficiency and the use of alternative fuels offers a way for companies to reduce fuel costs and/or limit exposure to volatile fuel pricing, future regulatory costs, and other consequences of GHG emissions. While newer aircraft and trucks are generally more fuel-efficient, existing fleets may be retrofitted. Capital investments in more fuel-efficient airplanes and/or vehicles and emerging fuel-management technology may potentially reduce ongoing fuel expenses and improve profitability. It can also help companies potentially capture market share of customers seeking low-carbon shipping solutions.

# Supply Chain Management

## Topic Summary

Many companies in the Air Freight & Logistics industry contract with large, complex networks of asset-based third-party providers to provide freight transportation services to their customers. Contracting is especially common among companies providing freight forwarding, logistics, brokerage, and intermodal services. These contractors range across all modes of transport such as motor carriers, railroads, air freight, and ocean carriers. Companies need to manage the relationships with their contractors in order to ensure that contractor actions that lead to environmental or social impacts do not result in material adverse effects on their own operations, such as decreased brand value. At the same time, companies that are able to offer low-carbon logistics solutions may capture market share from customers seeking to reduce the carbon footprint of their shipments.

#### Page 34

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Water is vital to the Household & Personal Products industry, both as a coolant in manufacturing processes and as a main input for many of the industry's products. Water is becoming a scarcer resource around the world due to increasing consumption as a result of population growth, rapid urbanization, and reduced supplies due to drought and climate change. Many firms in this industry have operations in regions of the world that are facing water scarcity. Without careful planning, companies could face increased costs or, worse, lose access to water in these regions, thereby presenting a risk to production. Having rigorous checks in place to ensure a steady supply of water to all factories, as well as investing in technology to increase the efficiency of water use, will help firms in this industry keep a lower risk profile as water scarcity becomes a more pressing global issue.

# Environmental & Social Impacts of Palm Oil Supply Chain

## Topic Summary

Palm oil has rapidly risen in popularity as a cheap input for a wide range of goods in the
Household & Personal Products industry, including cleaning products, candles, and
cosmetics. Palm oil harvesting in specific regions of the world can contribute to
deforestation, GHG emissions, and other environmental and social problems. If not
sourced responsibly, palm oil materials contribute to environmental and social
externalities that can present reputational and regulatory risks for companies. Further,
companies in this industry are exposed to the risk of supply chain disruptions, input
price increases, and reputational damage associated with environmental and social
externalities from palm oil sourcing. Thus, companies face pressure to track and
responsibly source palm oil. Additionally, they face pressure to ensure minimum
standards for working conditions in the supply chain, as the production of palm oil is
often associated with labor issues. Implementing sourcing standards can contribute to
reducing risks, as can innovations at the product-design phase to reduce dependence on
controversial materials such as palm oil.

## Metrics

CG-HP-430a.1. Amount of palm oil sourced, percentage certified through the
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) supply chains as (a) Identity

     (RSPO) claim for each of the RSPO supply chain models: (a) Identity Preserved (IP),
     (b) Segregated (SG), (c) Mass Balance (MB), or (d) Book & Claim (B&C).

     2.1   B&C transactions are represented by ""RSPO Credits"" purchased in the RSPO
           PalmTrace platform.

     2.2   The percentage shall be calculated as the weight in each respective RSPO
           supply chain model (IP, SG, MB, or B&C) of RSPO-certified palm oil sourced
           by the entity divided by the total weight, in metric tons, of palm oil
           sourced by the entity.

3    The entity may discuss other strategies, approaches, and mechanisms used to
     manage risks and opportunities associated with the environmental and social
     impacts of palm oil sourcing.

# Product Lifecycle Management

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Hardware industry face increasing challenges associated with environmental and social externalities attributed to product manufacturing, transport, use, and disposal. Rapid obsolescence of hardware products exacerbates the externalities. Companies are therefore designing more products with the entire lifecycle in mind. Specific considerations include energy efficiency of products, hazardous material inputs, and designing for and facilitating safe end-of-life disposal and recycling. Companies that prioritize designing and manufacturing products with improved environmental and social impacts can avoid costs associated with externalities, and are more likely to grow consumer demand and market share, while eliminating potentially harmful materials. Furthermore, companies that are able to minimize environmental and social externalities of products will be less exposed to increasing regulation and costs, such as those related to extended producer responsibility.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Marine transportation companies generate emissions mainly from the combustion of diesel in ship engines. The industry's reliance on heavy fuel oil (""bunker fuel"") is of material concern due to rising fuel costs and intensifying greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations. The industry is among the most fuel efficient of the major transportation modes in terms of fuel use per ton shipped. However, due to the size of the industry, its contribution to the global GHG inventory is still significant. Recent environmental regulations are driving the adoption of more fuel-efficient engines and the use of cleaner-burning fuels. Fuel constitutes a major expense for industry players, providing a further incentive for investing in upgrades or retrofits to boost fuel efficiency.

#### Page 204

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Alcoholic Beverages industry rely on both purchased electricity and fuel as critical inputs for value creation. Fossil fuel and electrical energy consumption can contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. These impacts have the potential to affect the value of companies in this industry as regulations of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and new incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy could lead to increased price volatility for fossil fuels and conventional electricity while making alternative sources cost-competitive. Companies that manage their overall energy use through increased efficiency and use of alternative energy sources can increase profitability by lowering expenses and reducing risk.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Water management relates to a company's direct water usage, the exposure of its operations to water-scarce regions, and its management of wastewater. Companies in the Alcoholic Beverages industry use a large amount of water in their operations, as water is a key input to their finished products. Given alcoholic beverage companies' heavy reliance on large volumes of clean water and the fact that water stress is increasing in different regions globally, companies may be exposed to supply disruptions that could significantly impact operations and add to costs. Companies operating in water-stressed regions that fail to address local water concerns may face further risk of losing their social license to operate. Improving water management through increased efficiency and recycling, particularly in regions with baseline water stress, can lead to lower operating costs, reduced risk, and higher intangible asset value.

## Metrics

# Environmental & Social Impacts of Ingredient Supply Chain

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Alcoholic Beverages industry manage global supply chains to source a wide range of ingredient inputs. How companies screen, monitor, and engage with suppliers on environmental and social topics affects companies' ability to secure supply and manage price fluctuations. Supply chain interruption can cause loss of revenue and negatively impact market share if companies are not able to find alternatives for key suppliers or have to source ingredients at higher cost. Supply chain management issues related to labor practices, environmental responsibility, ethics or corruption may also result in regulatory fines and/or increased long-term operational costs. The consumer-facing nature of the industry increases the reputational risks associated with supplier actions. Managing a company's exposure to environmental and social risks can lead to improved supply chain resiliency and enhanced reputation. Companies can engage with key suppliers to manage environmental and social risks to improve supply chain resiliency, mitigate reputational risks, and potentially increase consumer demand or capture new market opportunities.

## Metrics

FB-AB-430a.1. Suppliers' social and environmental responsibility audit (1) non-conformance rate and (2) associated corrective action rate for (a) major and (b) minor non-conformances

1 The entity shall disclose its supplier facilities' (1) non-conformance rate with external social and environmental audit standard(s) or internally developed supplier code(s) of conduct for (a) major non-conformances, and separately, (b) minor non-conformances.

1.1 A major non-conformance is defined as the highest severity of non-conformance and require escalation by auditors. Major non-conformances confirm the presence of underage child workers (below the legal age for work or apprenticeship), forced labor, health and safety issues that can cause immediate danger to life or serious injury, and/or environmental practices that can cause serious and immediate harm to the community. Major non-conformance includes material breach or systemic breaking of code requirement or law. Major non-conformances may also be referred to as critical or priority non-conformances.

1.2 A minor non-conformance is defined as a non-conformance that by itself is not indicative of a systemic problem with the management system. Minor non-conformances are typically isolated or random incidents and represent a low risk to workers and/or the environment.

1.3 The entity shall calculate the non-conformance rates as the total number of non-conformances (in each respective category) identified among its supplier facilities divided by the number of supplier facilities audited.

# Ingredient Sourcing

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Alcoholic Beverages industry source a wide range of ingredients, largely agricultural inputs, from suppliers worldwide. The industry's ability to source ingredients and at certain price points fluctuates with supply availability, which may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management, and other resource scarcity considerations. This exposure can lead to price volatility and can affect company profitability. Ultimately, climate change, water scarcity, and land-use restriction present risks to a company's long-term ability to source key materials and ingredients. Companies that source ingredients that are more productive, effectively cultivated, and less resource-intensive, or work closely with suppliers to increase their adaptability to climate change and manage exposure to other resource scarcity risks will be better protected from price volatility and/or supply disruptions.

# Industry Description

Oil and gas services companies provide support services, manufacture equipment, or are contract drillers for oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) companies. The drilling and drilling-support segment comprises companies that drill for oil and natural gas on-shore and off-shore on a contract basis. Companies in this segment may also manufacture jack-up rigs, semisubmersible rigs, and drill ships. Companies in the oilfield services segment manufacture equipment that is used in the extraction, storage, and transportation of oil and natural gas. They also provide support services such as seismic surveying, equipment rental, well cementing, and well monitoring. These services are commonly provided on a contractual basis, and the customer will purchase or lease the materials and equipment from the service provider. Service companies may also provide personnel or subject matter expertise as part of their scope of service. The contractual relationship between oil and gas services companies and their customers plays a significant role in determining the material impacts of their sustainability performance. Besides the rates charged, companies compete on the basis of their operational and safety performance, technology and process offerings, and reputation.

# Emissions Reduction Services & Fuels Management

## Topic Summary

While direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and associated regulatory risks are relatively low for oil and gas services providers relative to other industries, emissions from the operations of their customers—the oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) companies—can be significant. Emissions include GHGs that can contribute to climate change as well as other air pollutants that can have significant localized human health and environmental impacts. Increasing regulation and high costs of fuels associated with these emissions present substantial risk to E&P companies. This is driving companies to seek ways to lower their emissions, including converting pumps and engines to run on natural gas instead of diesel fuel. Oil and gas services companies compete for contracts with E&P companies partly on the basis of providing cutting-edge, efficient technologies that can help customers reduce costs and improve process efficiencies. Services companies can gain a competitive advantage and protect their revenues and market share by providing customers with services and equipment that reduce the emissions and fuel consumption of E&P activities, and by capturing saleable gas that may otherwise be flared or escape through leaks.

# Industry Description

The Agricultural Products industry is engaged in processing, trading, and distributing vegetables and fruits, and producing and milling agricultural commodities such as grains, sugar, consumable oils, maize, soybeans, and animal feed. Agricultural products are sold directly to consumers and to businesses for use in consumer and industrial products. Companies in the industry typically purchase agricultural products from entities that grow such products (either directly or indirectly) to then conduct value-adding activities (e.g., processing, trading, distributing, and milling). Agricultural products companies are also involved in wholesale and distribution. Companies in the industry may source a substantial portion of agricultural commodities from third-party growers in various countries. Therefore, managing sustainability risks within the supply chain is critical to securing a reliable supply of raw materials and reducing the risk of price increases and volatility over the long term.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Agricultural Products industry generate direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the processing and transportation of goods via land and sea freight operations. Emissions regulations may increase the cost of capital, operational costs, and affect the operational efficiency of companies that do not have strategies in place to manage GHG emissions. Employing innovative technologies that use alternative fuels and energy inputs—including biomass waste generated from internal processes—and improving fuel efficiency are ways companies can limit exposure to volatile fuel pricing, supply disruptions, future regulatory costs, and other potential consequences of GHG emissions.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Processing and milling agricultural products requires substantial energy input. While some agricultural products companies generate energy on-site through the direct combustion of fossil fuels and/or biomass, most energy is procured from the electrical grid. Energy consumption contributes to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. Energy management affects current and future costs of operation. Climate regulation and other sustainability factors could result in higher and/or more volatile electricity and fuel prices, increasing operating costs for agricultural products companies. Therefore, energy efficiency gained through process improvements can lower operating costs. The tradeoff between on-site versus grid-sourced electricity as well as the use of alternative energy can play important roles in influencing both the long-term cost and reliability of a company's energy supply and the extent of regulatory impact from direct versus indirect emissions.

## Metrics

FB-AG-130a.1. (1) Operational energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

The Agricultural Products industry relies on water for processing activities, and companies in the industry also typically generate wastewater, or effluent. The availability of water, due to physical availability and/or regulatory access, directly impacts the industry's ability to efficiently operate processing facilities. Companies in the industry are increasingly exposed to water-related risks and regulations, which may increase capital expenditure costs, operating costs, remediation costs, and/or potential fines. Companies can manage water-related risks and opportunities and mitigate long-term costs through capital investments and assessment of facility locations relative to water scarcity risks, improvements to operational efficiency, and work with regulators and communities on issues related to water access and effluent. Risks related to crop production that are driven by water availability and access are addressed in a separate supply chain-oriented topic, Ingredient Sourcing.

# Ingredient Sourcing

## Topic Summary

Agricultural products companies source a wide variety of commodities and ingredients from farmers and/or intermediary distributors. The industry's ability to reliably source ingredients at desired price points fluctuates with crop yield, which may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management, and other resource scarcity considerations. Companies that source more productive and less resource-intensive crops, or those that work closely with suppliers to increase their adaptability to climate change and other resource scarcity risks, will be better protected from volatility in crop prices and from disruptions in crop supplies. Additionally, companies may improve their brand reputation and develop new market opportunities. Failure to effectively manage sourcing risks can lead to higher costs of capital, reduced margins, and constrained revenue growth.

# Environmental Footprint of Hardware Infrastructure

## Topic Summary

With the Internet & Media Services industry providing a growing amount of content and service offerings, companies in this industry increasingly own, operate, or rent more data centers and other hardware. Thus, the management of the energy and water use associated with IT hardware infrastructure is of great importance to shareholder value. Data centers need to be powered continuously. Disruptions to the energy supply can have a material impact on operations, depending on the magnitude and timing of the disruption. Companies face a trade-off between energy and water consumption due to data center cooling needs. Cooling data centers with water instead of chillers is a means of improving energy efficiency, but it can lead to dependence on significant local water resources. Decisions about data center specifications are important for managing costs, obtaining a reliable supply of energy and water, and lowering reputational risks, particularly as there is an increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and as opportunities arise from innovations in energy efficiency and renewable energy.

# Energy Management in Manufacturing

## Topic Summary

Solar panel manufacturing typically uses electrical energy purchased from the grid. Energy can account for a considerable share of the total cost of production. In light of rising energy costs and regulatory uncertainty surrounding the future of fossil-based energy, companies that diversify their energy sources may be better able to manage the associated risks and maintain a reliable energy supply. Companies that minimize their energy use through effective energy management can reduce costs and gain a competitive advantage through operational efficiency and competitive pricing of products. This is particularly important given the intense price competition within the solar technology industry.

# Water Management in Manufacturing

## Topic Summary

Solar photovoltaic panel manufacturing can be water-intensive, and ultra-pure water is a critical input in some processes. The manufacturing process can also generate wastewater, which must be treated before disposal or reuse, and can therefore result in operating costs and additional capital expenditures. Furthermore, depending on their location, solar equipment manufacturing facilities may be exposed to the risk of reduced water availability (scarcity) and related cost increases or operational disruptions. The use of local water resources is a risk that can generate tension with local water users, potentially disrupting manufacturing operations and adversely impacting brand value. To mitigate water supply and treatment risks, companies can adopt various strategies such as recycling process water, improving production techniques to lower water intensity, and improving water treatment systems.

# Management of Energy Infrastructure Integration & Related Regulations

## Topic Summary

Companies in the industry have faced challenges in establishing solar energy as a cost-competitive means of energy production and GHG reduction, and have thus encountered difficulty in capturing a greater share of global energy generation. In order to promote greater adoption of solar, the industry can benefit by preventing systemic disruptions to the existing energy infrastructure and essential energy services. Companies are innovating to overcome the technical challenges of increasing solar integration with the grid. They are also engaging with regulatory agencies and policymakers to reduce regulatory barriers to the adoption of solar energy, many of which are emerging due to the concern around increasing overall grid electricity costs and grid disruptions. Solar companies are investing in innovative technologies to reduce hardware and installation costs, and are working toward business-model innovation to reduce the cost of capital and facilitate the purchase of solar energy systems. Solar technology companies can improve their competitiveness through deploying one or more of these strategies successfully to ensure their ability to scale over the long term.
