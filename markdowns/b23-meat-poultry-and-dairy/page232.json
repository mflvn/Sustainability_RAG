{"page_number": 232, "text_content": "1.2    The scope of GHG emissions includes the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083).\n\n2    The entity shall discuss its emission reduction target(s) and analyze its performance against the target(s), including the following, where relevant:\n\n2.1    The scope of the emission reduction target (e.g., the percentage of total emissions to which the target is applicable);\n\n2.2    Whether the target is absolute- or intensity-based, and the metric denominator, if it is an intensity-based target;\n\n2.3    The percentage reduction against the base year, with the base year representing the first year against which emissions are evaluated toward the achievement of the target;\n\n2.4    The timelines for the reduction activity, including the start year, the target year, and the base year;\n\n2.5    The mechanism(s) for achieving the target; and\n\n2.6    Any circumstances in which the target or base year emissions have been, or may be, recalculated retrospectively or the target or base year has been reset.\n\n3    The entity shall discuss the activities and investments required to achieve the plans and/or targets, and any risks or limiting factors that might affect achievement of the plans and/or targets.\n\n4    The entity shall discuss the scope of its strategies, plans, and/or reduction targets, such as how they relate to different business units, geographies, or emissions sources.\n\n5    The entity shall discuss whether its strategies, plans, and/or reduction targets are related to, or associated with, emissions limiting and/or emissions reporting-based programs or regulations (e.g., the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, Quebec Cap-and-Trade System, California Cap-and-Trade Program), including regional, national, international, or sectoral programs.\n\n6    Disclosure of strategies, plans, and/or reduction targets shall be limited to activities that were ongoing (active) or reached completion during the reporting period."}
