## Industry Description

The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry produces raw and processed animal products, including meats, eggs, and dairy products, for human and animal consumption. Key activities include animal raising, slaughtering, processing, and packaging. The industry's largest companies have international operations, and companies are vertically integrated to varying degrees, depending on the type of animal produced. Large industry operators typically rely on contract or independent farmers to supply their animals, and may have varying degrees of control over their operations. The industry sells products primarily to the Processed Foods industry and to retail distributors that distribute finished products to key end markets including restaurants, livestock and pet feed consumers, and grocery retailers.

#### Page 229

29 Note to FB-MP-000.B – Categories of animal protein production may be based on animal (e.g., chicken, pork, beef) and/or product type (e.g., milk, shell eggs). Units of measure shall be appropriate to the animal or product category (e.g., metric tons, number/head, gallons).

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry generates significant Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both livestock and energy-intensive industrial processes. GHG emissions contribute to climate change and create additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for meat, poultry, and dairy companies due to climate change mitigation policies. The majority of the industry's emissions stem directly from the animals themselves through the release of methane during enteric fermentation, and from manure storage and processing. The direct emissions from raising and producing livestock represent a significant portion of total GHG emissions released among all sources. These emissions sources are currently not widely regulated, which presents uncertainties as to the future of GHG regulations for the industry. Companies in this industry also use large quantities of fossil fuels to meet energy needs, generating additional direct GHG emissions and increasing exposure to regulatory risks. Future emission regulations could result in additional operating and/or compliance costs. By implementing new technologies to capture animal emissions and focusing on energy efficiency, companies can mitigate regulatory risk and volatile energy costs while also limiting their GHG emissions.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry relies heavily on purchased electricity and fuel as critical inputs for value creation. Companies' use of electricity and fossil fuels in their operations results in direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. Purchased electricity is a significant operating cost for meat, poultry, and dairy companies. Efficient energy usage is essential to maintain a competitive advantage in this industry, as purchased fuels and electricity account for a significant portion of total production costs. Decisions regarding the use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site generation of electricity versus purchasing from the grid can play an important role in influencing both the costs and the reliability of the energy supply.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry is water-intensive both in raising livestock and industrial processing. Additionally, companies in the industry typically generate wastewater, or effluent, from both animal production and processing activities. As water scarcity becomes an issue of growing importance due to population growth, increasing consumption per capita, poor water management, and climate change, companies in the industry may face higher operational costs or lost revenues due to water shortages and/or regulations resulting in production reduction. Companies can manage water-related risks and opportunities through capital investments and assessment of facility locations relative to water scarcity risks, improvements to operational efficiency, and partnerships with regulators and communities on issues related to water access and effluent.

# Land Use & Ecological Impacts

## Topic Summary

Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry operations have diverse ecological impacts, primarily because of significant land-use needs to raise livestock and the contamination of the air, land, and groundwater by animal waste. While the impacts are different, both traditional and Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO) lead to significant ecological impacts. The primary concern from CAFOs and animal-product processing facilities is the generation of large and concentrated amounts of waste and pollutants into the environment. Treating effluent and waste from facilities involves significant costs. Non-CAFO animal farming, which requires large tracts of pastureland, can lead to physical degradation of land resources. Land use and ecological impacts pose legal and regulatory risks in the form of fines, litigation, and difficulties obtaining permits for facility expansions or waste discharges.

# Animal & Feed Sourcing

## Topic Summary

Meat, poultry, and dairy companies source animal and animal feed from a range of suppliers depending on animal species. The industry's ability to reliably source animals and animal feed at desired price points may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management, and other resource scarcity considerations. Companies that select and work with suppliers who are less resource-intensive and who actively manage adaptation to climate change and other resource scarcity risks, will be better protected from potential price volatility and supply disruptions. Additionally, such companies may improve their brand reputation and develop new market opportunities. Failure to effectively manage sourcing risks can lead to higher costs of capital, reduced margins, and constrained revenue growth.
