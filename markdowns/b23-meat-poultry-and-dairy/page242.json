{"page_number": 242, "text_content": "2.1 The entity shall identify contract producers that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40\u201380%) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.\n\nFB-MP-440a.3. Discussion of strategy to manage opportunities and risks to feed sourcing and livestock supply presented by climate change\n\n1 The entity shall discuss the risks and/or opportunities that are presented by climate change scenarios to its feed sourcing and livestock supply.\n\n1.1 Feed-sourcing risks and opportunities include those at the cultivation, milling and other processing, and transportation phases of animal feed production.\n\n1.2 Livestock production risks and opportunities include those affecting all lifecycle phases of bringing animal protein to market, including breeding, grazing, feedlot, slaughter, processing, and distribution/transportation of live animals and processed animal protein products.\n\n2 The entity may identify the risks presented by climate change, including, but not limited to, availability of water, shifts in rangeland quality, disease migration, and more frequent extreme weather events.\n\n3 The entity may discuss how climate change scenarios will manifest (e.g., at the point they will affect the entity's supply chain), how each type of feed (e.g., soybean meal, cornmeal and other grains, or hay) or livestock (e.g., beef cattle, dairy cattle, pigs, or poultry) may be affected, and how other operating conditions (e.g., transportation and logistics or physical infrastructure) will be affected.\n\n4 The entity shall discuss efforts to assess and monitor the impacts of climate change and the related strategies it employs to adapt to any risks and/or recognize any opportunities.\n\n4.1 For feed, strategies include, but are not limited to, use of insurance, investments in hedging instruments, supply chain diversification, and ecosystem and biodiversity management.\n\n4.2 For livestock, strategies include, but are not limited to, use of insurance, investments in hedging instruments, supply chain diversification, ecosystem and biodiversity management, and development of tolerant livestock breeds.\n\n5 The entity may discuss the probability that risks and opportunities will come to fruition, the likely magnitude of the impact on financial results and operating conditions, and the timeframe over which such risks and opportunities are expected to manifest.\n\n6 The entity may include discussion of the methods or models used to develop the climate change scenario(s) it uses, including the use of global gridded crop models or scientific research provided by governmental and non-governmental organizations (e.g., Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Climate Scenario Process)."}
