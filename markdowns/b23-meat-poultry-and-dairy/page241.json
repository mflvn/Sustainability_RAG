{"page_number": 241, "text_content": "# Animal & Feed Sourcing\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nMeat, poultry, and dairy companies source animal and animal feed from a range of suppliers depending on animal species. The industry's ability to reliably source animals and animal feed at desired price points may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management, and other resource scarcity considerations. Companies that select and work with suppliers who are less resource-intensive and who actively manage adaptation to climate change and other resource scarcity risks, will be better protected from potential price volatility and supply disruptions. Additionally, such companies may improve their brand reputation and develop new market opportunities. Failure to effectively manage sourcing risks can lead to higher costs of capital, reduced margins, and constrained revenue growth.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFB-MP-440a.1. Percentage of animal feed sourced from regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of animal feed sourced from regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress.\n\n1.1 Animal feed includes soybean meal, cornmeal and other grains, and other fodder provided to livestock, but excludes forage.\n\n2 The scope of disclosure shall include feed grown and/or manufactured by the entity and feed that is purchased by the entity.\n\n3 The percentage shall be calculated as the weight of animal feed sourced from regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress divided by the total weight of animal feed sourced by the entity.\n\n3.1 The entity shall identify animal feed sourced from locations with High (40-80%) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.\n\nFB-MP-440a.2. Percentage of contracts with producers located in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of contracts with producers located in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress.\n\n1.1 A contract producer (or grower) is a party with which the entity has an agreement under which the party typically agrees to provide facilities, labor, utilities, and care for livestock owned by the entity in return for payment.\n\n2 The percentage shall be calculated as the value of contracts associated with entities located in water-stressed regions divided by the total value of contracts associated with contract production of animal protein."}
