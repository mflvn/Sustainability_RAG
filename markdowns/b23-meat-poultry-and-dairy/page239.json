While the impacts are different, both traditional and Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO) lead to significant ecological impacts. The primary concern from CAFOs and animal-product processing facilities is the generation of large and concentrated amounts of waste and pollutants into the environment. Treating effluent and waste from facilities involves significant costs. Non-CAFO animal farming, which requires large tracts of pastureland, can lead to physical degradation of land resources. Land use and ecological impacts pose legal and regulatory risks in the form of fines, litigation, and difficulties obtaining permits for facility expansions or waste discharges.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFB-MP-160a.1. Amount of animal litter and manure generated, percentage managed according to a nutrient management plan\n\n1    The entity shall disclose the total amount, in metric tons, of animal litter and manure generated at its facilities.\n\n1.1    The scope of animal litter and manure includes both dry and liquid manures and litter.\n\n2    The entity shall disclose the percentage of animal litter and manure generated from facilities that implement a nutrient management plan divided by the total amount of animal litter and manure generated.\n\n2.1    A nutrient management plan is defined as a documented management practice that addresses the generation, collection, treatment, storage, and agronomic use of all manure.\n\n2.2    At a minimum, the nutrient management plan shall meet the following minimum specific elements:\n\n2.2.1    Background and Site Information\n\n2.2.2    Manure and Wastewater Handling and Storage\n\n2.2.3    Farmstead Safety and Security\n\n2.2.4    Land Treatment Practices\n\n2.2.5    Soil and Risk Assessment Analyses\n\n2.2.6    Nutrient Management\n\n2.2.7    Recordkeeping\n\n2.2.8    References"}
