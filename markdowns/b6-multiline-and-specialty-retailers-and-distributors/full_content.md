# Industry Description

The Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors industry encompasses a variety of retailing categories such as department stores, mass merchants, home products stores, and warehouse clubs, as well as a smaller segment of distributors like electronics wholesalers and automotive wholesalers. Common to these companies (except for the distribution segment) is that they manage global supply chains to anticipate consumer demands, keep costs low, and keep products stocked in their brick-and-mortar storefronts. This is a highly competitive industry, in which each company category generally has a small number of key players, characterized by generally low margins. The relatively substitutable nature of retail makes companies in this industry especially susceptible to reputational risks.

Note: SASB has separate standards for the Food Retailers & Distributors (FB-FR), Drug Retailers (HC-DR), E-Commerce (CG-EC), and Apparel, Accessories & Footwear (CG-AA) industries. Retail companies involved in food or drug retail, e-commerce, or apparel, accessories, and footwear manufacturing should also consider the disclosure topics and metrics outlined in these other standards.

# Energy Management in Retail & Distribution

## Topic Summary

Companies in this industry require significant amounts of energy for their retail facilities and warehouses. Sustainability factors—such as the increasing number of GHG-emissions regulations, incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy—are leading to price increases in conventional electricity sources while making alternative sources more cost-competitive. Fossil fuel-based energy production and consumption contribute to significant environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. Decisions regarding energy sourcing and type, as well as the use of alternative energy, can create trade-offs related to the energy supply's cost and reliability for operations. It is becoming increasingly important for companies to manage their overall energy efficiency, and their access to alternative energy sources. Efficiency in this area can have financial implications through direct cost savings, which are particularly beneficial in this low-margin industry.

## Metrics

CG-MR-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable

1    The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

    1.1    The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

    1.2    The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

    1.3    In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2    The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.

    2.1    The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3    The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

    3.1    Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

    3.2    The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3.3 The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity.

3.3.1 For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.2 For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.3 The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of renewable energy.

3.4 For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from biomass sources is limited to the following:

3.4.2 Energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state renewable portfolio standard.

4 The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data including electricity from solar or wind energy).
