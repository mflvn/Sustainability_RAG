{"page_number": 39, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors industry encompasses a variety of retailing categories such as department stores, mass merchants, home products stores, and warehouse clubs, as well as a smaller segment of distributors like electronics wholesalers and automotive wholesalers. Common to these companies (except for the distribution segment) is that they manage global supply chains to anticipate consumer demands, keep costs low, and keep products stocked in their brick-and-mortar storefronts. This is a highly competitive industry, in which each company category generally has a small number of key players, characterized by generally low margins. The relatively substitutable nature of retail makes companies in this industry especially susceptible to reputational risks.\n\nNote: SASB has separate standards for the Food Retailers & Distributors (FB-FR), Drug Retailers (HC-DR), E-Commerce (CG-EC), and Apparel, Accessories & Footwear (CG-AA) industries. Retail companies involved in food or drug retail, e-commerce, or apparel, accessories, and footwear manufacturing should also consider the disclosure topics and metrics outlined in these other standards."}
