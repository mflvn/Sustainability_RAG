Sustainability factors\u2014such as the increasing number of GHG-emissions regulations, incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy\u2014are leading to price increases in conventional electricity sources while making alternative sources more cost-competitive. Fossil fuel-based energy production and consumption contribute to significant environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. Decisions regarding energy sourcing and type, as well as the use of alternative energy, can create trade-offs related to the energy supply's cost and reliability for operations. It is becoming increasingly important for companies to manage their overall energy efficiency, and their access to alternative energy sources. Efficiency in this area can have financial implications through direct cost savings, which are particularly beneficial in this low-margin industry.\n\n## Metrics\n\nCG-MR-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable\n\n1    The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n    1.1    The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n    1.2    The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.\n\n    1.3    In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n2    The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.\n\n    2.1    The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3    The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.\n\n    3.1    Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.\n\n    3.2    The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption."}
