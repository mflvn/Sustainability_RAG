(1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage heavy fuel oil, (3) percentage onshore power supply (OPS), (4) percentage renewable\n\n1     The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n1.1    The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n1.2    The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period."}
