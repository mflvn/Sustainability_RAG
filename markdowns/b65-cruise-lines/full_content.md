# Industry Description

The Cruise Lines industry comprises companies that provide passenger transportation and leisure entertainment, including deep sea cruises and river cruises. The industry is dominated by a few large companies. Cruises aim to provide a luxury resort experience for thousands of passengers at a time. The Cruise Lines industry has often been the fastest-growing segment of the travel industry, but is very cyclical.

118 Note to TR-CL-000.A – Available lower berth (ALB) is a measure of the standard capacity of a cruise ship, usually assuming two people per available cabin. It accounts for changes in fleet size, itineraries, and passenger capacity. Available lower berth kilometers (ALB-KM) are computed by multiplying ALB on each leg by the number of kilometers traveled on that leg.

119 Note to TR-CL-000.B – Average passenger cruise days (APCD) is computed as the number of available lower berths on a ship multiplied by the number of days that those berths are available to passengers during the reporting period.

120 Note to TR-CL-000.C – Shipboard employees are those employees who work aboard the entity's vessels (including direct and contract employees) during the reporting period.

121 Note to TR-CL-000.D – Cruise passengers is the number of passengers aboard the entity's vessels, excluding employees.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Cruise lines generate emissions mainly from the combustion of diesel in ship engines. The industry's reliance on heavy fuel oil ("bunker fuel") is of material concern due to rising fuel costs and intensifying greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations. Evolving environmental regulations are driving the adoption of more fuel-efficient engines, engine retrofits, and the use of cleaner-burning fuels. Fuel constitutes a major expense for industry players, providing a further incentive for investing in upgrades or retrofits to boost fuel efficiency. In addition, violation of GHG regulations can lead to fines and compliance costs.

## Metrics

### TR-CL-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions

1. The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol—carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).

   1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).

   1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.

2. Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).

   2.1 Acceptable calculation methodologies include those that conform to the GHG Protocol as the base reference, but provide additional guidance, such as industry- or region-specific guidance. Examples include, but are not limited to:

      2.1.1 GHG Reporting Guidance for the Aerospace Industry published by International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG)

      2.1.2 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidance: Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

      2.1.3 India GHG Inventory Program

      2.1.4 ISO 14064-1

#### Page 619

2.1.5 Petroleum Industry Guidelines for reporting GHG emissions, 2nd edition, 2011, published by IPIECA

2.1.6 Protocol for the quantification of greenhouse gas emissions from waste management activities published by Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EpE)

2.2 GHG emissions data shall be consolidated and disclosed according to the approach with which the entity consolidates its financial reporting data, which is generally aligned with the "financial control" approach defined by the GHG Protocol, and the approach published by the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) described in REQ-07, "Organisational boundary," of the CDSB Framework for reporting environmental information, natural capital and associated business impacts (April 2018).

3 The entity may discuss any change in its emissions from the previous reporting period, including whether the change was due to emissions reductions, divestment, acquisition, mergers, changes in output, and/or changes in calculation methodology.

4 In the case that current reporting of GHG emissions to the CDP or other entity (e.g., a national regulatory disclosure program) differs in terms of the scope and consolidation approach used, the entity may disclose those emissions. However, primary disclosure shall be according to the guidelines described above.

5 The entity may discuss the calculation methodology for its emissions disclosure, such as if data are from continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS), engineering calculations, or mass balance calculations.

TR-CL-110a.2. Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets

For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

1.2    The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

#### Page 621

1.3    In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

3.1    OPS includes the shoreside electrical power consumed by a ship at berth while its main and auxiliary engines are turned off.

3.2    The percentage shall be calculated as OPS consumption divided by total energy consumption.

4      The entity shall disclose (4) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

4.1    Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

4.2    The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

4.3    The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity.
