# Industry Description

The Internet Media & Services industry consists of two main segments. The Internet Media segment includes companies providing search engines and internet advertising channels, online gaming, and online communities such as social networks, as well as content, usually easily searchable, such as educational, medical, health, sports, or news content. The Internet-based Services segment includes companies selling services mainly through the Internet. The industry generates revenues primarily from online advertising, on usually free content, with other sources of revenue being subscription fees, content sales, or sale of user information to interested third parties.

# Environmental Footprint of Hardware Infrastructure

## Topic Summary

With the Internet & Media Services industry providing a growing amount of content and service offerings, companies in this industry increasingly own, operate, or rent more data centers and other hardware. Thus, the management of the energy and water use associated with IT hardware infrastructure is of great importance to shareholder value. Data centers need to be powered continuously. Disruptions to the energy supply can have a material impact on operations, depending on the magnitude and timing of the disruption. Companies face a trade-off between energy and water consumption due to data center cooling needs. Cooling data centers with water instead of chillers is a means of improving energy efficiency, but it can lead to dependence on significant local water resources. Decisions about data center specifications are important for managing costs, obtaining a reliable supply of energy and water, and lowering reputational risks, particularly as there is an increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and as opportunities arise from innovations in energy efficiency and renewable energy.

## Metrics

TC-IM-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable

1    The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

     1.1   The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

     1.2   The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

     1.3   In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2    The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.

     2.1   The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3    The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

     3.1   Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

#### Page 561

3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3.3 The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity.

3.3.1 For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.2 For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.3 The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of renewable energy.

3.4 For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from biomass sources is limited to the following:

3.4.2 Energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state renewable portfolio standard.

4 The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data including electricity from solar or wind energy).

5 The entity may disclose the trailing twelve-month (TTM) weighted average power usage effectiveness (PUE) for its data centers.

5.1 PUE is defined as the ratio of the total amount of power used by a computer data center facility to the amount of power delivered to computing equipment.

#### Page 562

5.2    If disclosing PUE, the entity shall follow the guidance and calculation methodology described in PUE™: A Comprehensive Examination of the Metric (2014), published by ASHRAE and The Green Grid Association.

TC-IM-130a.2. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

1     The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources.

1.1    Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities.

2     The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources.

2.1    Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.

2.2    Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.

3     The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.

3.1    Water consumption is defined as:

3.1.1   Water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge;

3.1.2   Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service;

3.1.3   Water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea.

4     The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40-80 percent) or Extremely High (>80 percent) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.

5     The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn.

6     The entity shall disclose its water consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water consumed.
