# Industry Description

The Forestry Management industry consists of companies that own and/or manage natural and planted forestry lands and timber tracts, or operate non-retail tree nurseries and rubber plantations. The industry conducts its operations on lands that can be company-owned or leased from public or private landowners. Companies typically sell timber to wood products manufacturers, pulp and paper producers, energy producers, and a variety of other customers. The industry's largest companies operate primarily in and are domiciled in the U.S. and Canada. Some have international operations including in Brazil and New Zealand. While some integrated companies may also operate sawmills, wood products facilities, or pulp and paper facilities, sustainability issues arising from these activities are addressed in SASB's Building Products & Furnishings (CG-BP) and Pulp & Paper Products (RR-PP) industry standards.

# Ecosystem Services & Impacts

## Topic Summary

Along with their timber output, forests provide valuable ecosystem services including carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, water purification and storage, soil formation, and recreational opportunities. Meanwhile, in many regions, regulations related to water quality and endangered species protection, as well as harvesting rights that are contingent upon environmental preservation, can create operational risks for companies. As such, protecting or enhancing ecosystem services within managed forestlands could mitigate reputational, demand, and operational risks related to the potential adverse environmental impacts of forestry. Companies increasingly utilize third-party certification to demonstrate sustainable forestry management practices that serve to enhance the value and productivity of their forest assets, as well as to meet rising customer demand for sustainably produced forest products.

## Metrics

1. The entity shall disclose its total forestland area, in acres, that is certified to a third-party forest management standard, where:

   1.1 The scope includes forestlands owned, leased, and/or managed by the entity.

   1.2 Third-party forest management standards are those that certify that forests are harvested in a sustainable manner and cover environmental and social criteria including legal compliance, land rights, community and worker relations, environmental impact and biodiversity, forest management plans and practices, land use, wildlife habitat conservation, and water conservation, among others.

   1.3 Third-party forest management certifications include, but are not limited to, those promulgated by the following organizations (or the equivalent):

       1.3.1 American Tree Farm System (ATFS)

       1.3.2 Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)

2.2    How the entity enforces the sustainable forestry management plans in its non-certified forestlands, including the type and frequency of inspections.

2.3    The underlying references for its forestry management plan(s) for non-certified forestlands, including the degree to which its forest management practices are aligned with criteria outlined in third-party sustainable forestry management standards and ASTM D7480, Guide for Evaluating the Attributes of a Forest Management Plan; whether these references are codes, guidelines, standards, or regulations; and whether they were developed by the entity, an industry, organization, a third-party organization (e.g., a non-governmental organization), a governmental agency, or some combination of these groups

3    Where policies and practices to ensure sustainable forest management differ significantly by forestland, the entity shall describe differences for each non-certified forestland and indicate the percentage of acres to which they were applied.

4    The entity shall disclose whether any forest management certifications were involuntarily suspended or terminated during the reporting period (i.e., for failure to meet the standard or resolve major non-conformities).

5    The entity shall disclose which certification(s) was suspended or terminated, the total acreage of land for which certification was suspended or terminated, the reason stated by the certification body or bodies for why the certification was suspended or terminated, and any other explanatory information about the suspension or termination.

timber or timber ecosystem services to change in the future and the methods or
models used to develop these scenarios, including the use of global models or
scientific research provided by governmental and non-governmental
organizations.

5 The entity may discuss how management of non-timber ecosystem services is
expected to affect tree growth and timber yield.

# Climate Change Adaptation

## Topic Summary

Global climate change may create long-term business uncertainty for some forestry management companies. Variations in precipitation patterns and temperatures, more frequent extreme weather events and forest fires, and an increased prevalence of tree diseases and pests could adversely impact timberlands through increased mortality or diminished productivity. Conversely, climate change could also facilitate forest productivity through increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, a longer growing season, moderating temperatures in high latitudes, greater precipitation, and expanded geographic ranges for some species, positively impacting forest productivity. In light of such variability, companies could benefit from identifying and understanding potential long-term impacts of climate change on the productivity of forestlands, and adjusting forestry management strategies to optimize the productivity of their forestland assets.
