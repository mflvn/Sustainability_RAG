Description of approach to optimizing opportunities from ecosystem services provided by forestlands\n\n1 The entity shall discuss its strategy to optimize the opportunities created by the ecosystem services that its forestlands provide, where:\n\n1.1 Ecosystem services are defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment as the benefits obtained from ecosystems, which include: provisioning services (i.e., goods or products obtained from ecosystems), such as food, fresh water, timber, and fiber; regulating services (i.e., benefits obtained from an ecosystem's control of natural processes), such as climate, erosion, and pollination; cultural services (i.e., nonmaterial benefits obtained from an ecosystem), such as recreational and spiritual benefits; and supporting"}
