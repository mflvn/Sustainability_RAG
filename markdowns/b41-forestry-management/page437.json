{"page_number": 437, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Forestry Management industry consists of companies that own and/or manage natural and planted forestry lands and timber tracts, or operate non-retail tree nurseries and rubber plantations. The industry conducts its operations on lands that can be company-owned or leased from public or private landowners. Companies typically sell timber to wood products manufacturers, pulp and paper producers, energy producers, and a variety of other customers. The industry's largest companies operate primarily in and are domiciled in the U.S. and Canada. Some have international operations including in Brazil and New Zealand. While some integrated companies may also operate sawmills, wood products facilities, or pulp and paper facilities, sustainability issues arising from these activities are addressed in SASB's Building Products & Furnishings (CG-BP) and Pulp & Paper Products (RR-PP) industry standards.\n\n68 Note to RR-FM-160a.1 \u2013 The entity shall describe forestry management practices for non-certified forestlands, and for any forest management certifications that were suspended or terminated, the entity shall disclose the number, associated acreage, and stated reason for suspension or termination."}
