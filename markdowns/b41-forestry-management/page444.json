{"page_number": 444, "text_content": "# Climate Change Adaptation\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nGlobal climate change may create long-term business uncertainty for some forestry management companies. Variations in precipitation patterns and temperatures, more frequent extreme weather events and forest fires, and an increased prevalence of tree diseases and pests could adversely impact timberlands through increased mortality or diminished productivity. Conversely, climate change could also facilitate forest productivity through increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, a longer growing season, moderating temperatures in high latitudes, greater precipitation, and expanded geographic ranges for some species, positively impacting forest productivity. In light of such variability, companies could benefit from identifying and understanding potential long-term impacts of climate change on the productivity of forestlands, and adjusting forestry management strategies to optimize the productivity of their forestland assets.\n\n## Metrics\n\nRR-FM-450a.1. Description of strategy to manage opportunities for and risks to forest management and timber production presented by climate change\n\n1 The entity shall discuss the risks and/or opportunities that are presented by climate change scenarios to its owned, leased, and/or managed forestlands, including, where relevant, those presented by:\n\n1.1 Physical impacts including, but not limited to: increased temperatures, changes in growth rates, changes in seasonality, availability of water, pest migration, increased frequency of fires, and increased frequency of extreme weather events\n\n1.2 Existing and potential legislation and regulation related to climate change, including those that limit emissions, tax emissions, set up cap-and-trade systems, affect the demand for the entity's products, or otherwise affect the entity\n\n1.3 International accords relating to climate change\n\n1.4 Indirect consequences of regulation or business trends, including legal, technological, or other developments related to climate change\n\n1.5 Other political and social risks, such as increased harvesting restrictions, or stakeholder perceptions or concerns (e.g., those from local communities, non-governmental organizations, and regulatory agencies)\n\n3 For each of the risks and/or opportunities identified, the entity shall provide the following:\n\n2.1 A description of the risk or opportunity, including an explanation and qualitative assessment of current and anticipated (long-term and short-term) significant risks or opportunities associated with climate change"}
