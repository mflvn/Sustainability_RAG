Meanwhile, in many regions, regulations related to water quality and endangered species protection, as well as harvesting rights that are contingent upon environmental preservation, can create operational risks for companies. As such, protecting or enhancing ecosystem services within managed forestlands could mitigate reputational, demand, and operational risks related to the potential adverse environmental impacts of forestry. Companies increasingly utilize third-party certification to demonstrate sustainable forestry management practices that serve to enhance the value and productivity of their forest assets, as well as to meet rising customer demand for sustainably produced forest products.\n\n## Metrics\n\nRR-FM-160a.1. Area of forestland certified to a third-party forest management standard, percentage certified to each standard\n\n1. The entity shall disclose its total forestland area, in acres, that is certified to a third-party forest management standard, where:\n\n   1.1 The scope includes forestlands owned, leased, and/or managed by the entity.\n\n   1.2 Third-party forest management standards are those that certify that forests are harvested in a sustainable manner and cover environmental and social criteria including legal compliance, land rights, community and worker relations, environmental impact and biodiversity, forest management plans and practices, land use, wildlife habitat conservation, and water conservation, among others.\n\n   1.3 Third-party forest management certifications include, but are not limited to, those promulgated by the following organizations (or the equivalent):\n\n       1.3.1 American Tree Farm System (ATFS)\n\n       1.3.2 Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)\n\n       1.3.3 Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC)\n\n       1.3.4 Forest certification systems endorsed by the PEFC\n\n       1.3.5 Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI)\n\n2. If a forestland area is certified to multiple certification standards, the entity shall not account for the acreage more than once when calculating the total forestland area certified to a third-party forest management standard.\n\n3. The entity shall disclose the percentage of the total certified forestland that is certified to each forest management standard (e.g., FSC, SFI, PEFC, and ATFS) and indicate the associated certification(s) (e.g., FSC Forest Management Certification, SFI Forest Management Standard, PEFC Sustainable Forest Management certification, or ATFS Individual Third-Party certification)."}
