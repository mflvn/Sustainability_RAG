# Industry Description

The Drug Retailers industry comprises companies that operate retail pharmacies and distribution centers that supply retail stores. Stores may be company-owned or franchised. Large companies source drugs and other merchandise through wholesalers and distributors. The majority of the industry's revenues are derived from consumer sales of prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products; other goods sold include household goods, personal care products, and a limited selection of groceries. Additionally, the pharmacy retailer segment is expanding its health-focused services by offering clinics at various retail locations, which adds to the industry's shifting sustainability landscape.

---

30 Pharmacists are employees who dispense drugs prescribed by physicians and other health practitioners and provide information to patients about medications and their use. Pharmacists may advise physicians and other health practitioners on the selection, dosage, interactions, and side effects of medications.

# Energy Management in Retail

## Topic Summary

Chain drug retailers operate thousands of locations that consume large quantities of energy. Electricity is used primarily for lighting and refrigeration purposes. Energy demand is often increased by the fact that many retail locations operate around the clock. Energy efficiency in operation and the diversification of energy portfolios across a range of supply sources can mitigate exposure to rising energy costs and limit a company's contribution to indirect greenhouse gas emissions.

## Metrics

HC-DR-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable

1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.

2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3.3 The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green‐e Energy

Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity.

3.3.1 For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.2 For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.3 The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of renewable energy.

3.4 For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from biomass sources is limited to the following:

3.4.2 materials certified to a third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state renewable portfolio standard.

4 The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data including electricity from solar or wind energy).
