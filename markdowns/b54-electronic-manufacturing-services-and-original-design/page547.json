EMS companies provide assembly, logistics, and after-market services for original equipment manufacturers. The ODM segment of the industry provides engineering and design services for original equipment manufacturers and may own significant intellectual property. Although EMS & ODM companies produce equipment for a variety of sectors, the industry is closely associated with the hardware industry, which consists of companies that design technology hardware products such as personal computers, consumer electronics, and storage devices for both personal consumers and businesses.\n\nNote: The Electronic Manufacturing Services & Original Design Manufacturing industry does not include the design of technology hardware products. Companies that design and manufacture technology hardware products should consider the separate SASB Hardware Industry Standard (TC-HW) in addition to the SASB Electronic Manufacturing Services & Original Design Manufacturing Industry Standard (TC-ES)."}
