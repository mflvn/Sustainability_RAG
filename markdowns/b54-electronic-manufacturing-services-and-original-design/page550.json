{"text_content": "# Product Lifecycle Management\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nCompanies in the Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) & Original Design Manufacturing (ODM) industry, along with the industry's customers such as hardware companies, face increasing challenges associated with environmental externalities attributed to product manufacturing, transport, use, and disposal. Rapid obsolescence of hardware products exacerbates such externalities. The industry's products commonly contain hazardous materials, making safe end-of-life disposal a critical aspect to manage. Companies unable to minimize the environmental externalities of their products may face increased regulatory costs as local, regional, and national environmental laws place increasing emphasis on resource conservation and waste management. Through product innovation that facilitates end-of-life product recovery and the use of less-impactful materials, EMS & ODM manufacturers can achieve improvements in lifecycle impacts, reduce regulatory risk, and realize cost savings.\n\n## Metrics\n\nTC-ES-410a.1. Weight of end-of-life products and e-waste recovered, percentage recycled\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the weight, in metric tons, of end-of-life material that was recovered, including through reverse logistics services, recycling services, product take-back programs, and refurbishment services.\n\n1.1 End-of-life material that was recovered is defined as products, materials, and parts, including electronic waste material (e-waste), that at the end of their useful life would have otherwise been disposed of as waste or used for energy recovery, but have instead been collected.\n\n1.2 The scope of end-of-life material that was recovered includes materials physically handled by the entity.\n\n1.3 The scope of end-of-life material that was recovered includes materials that the entity did not take physical possession of, but were collected by a third party for the expressed purpose of reuse, recycling, or refurbishment.\n\n1.4 The scope of end-of-life material that was recovered excludes materials that have been collected for repair or that are in-warranty and subject to recall.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose the percentage of end-of-life material that was recovered and subsequently recycled.\n\n2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as the weight of end-of-life material that was recovered and subsequently recycled divided by the total weight of end-of-life material that was recovered.\n\n2.2 Recycled material (including remanufactured material) is defined as waste material that has been reprocessed or treated by means of production or manufacturing processes and made into a final product or a component for incorporation into a product.", "page_number": 550}
