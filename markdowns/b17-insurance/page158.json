As environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors have increasingly been shown to have a material impact on the performance of corporations and other assets, there is an increasing need for insurance companies to incorporate these factors into the management of their investments. Failure to address these issues could lead to diminished risk-adjusted returns of their portfolios and limit a company's ability to issue claim payments. Companies should therefore enhance disclosure on how ESG factors, including climate change and natural resource constraints, are incorporated into the investment of policy premiums and affect the portfolio risk.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFN-IN-410a.2.
