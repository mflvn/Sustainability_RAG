{"page_number": 166, "text_content": "2 The entity shall describe the processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks on insurance and reinsurance portfolios by geography, business division, or product segments.\n\n2.1 Climate-related risks are defined by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as:\n\n2.1.1 Physical risks from changing frequencies and intensities of weather-related perils\n\n2.1.2 Transition risks resulting from a reduction in insurable interest due to a decline in value, changing energy costs, or implementation of carbon regulation\n\n2.1.3 Liability risks that could intensify due to a possible increase in litigation\n\n3 The entity shall describe what it considers to be the relevant short-, medium-, and long-term horizons in the context of underwriting process for individual contracts as well as the management of firm-level risks and capital adequacy.\n\n4 The entity shall describe specific climate-related risks for each time horizon (short, medium, and long term) that the entity considers in the underwriting process for individual contracts as well as in the management of firm-level risks and capital adequacy.\n\n5 The entity shall describe the process for integration of climate-related risks in probabilistic mathematical models (i.e., catastrophic models).\n\n5.1 Discussion shall include, but is not limited to:\n\n5.1.1 The use of new and emerging datasets (e.g., for dam burst risk)\n\n5.1.2 The use of the critical input parameters, assumptions and considerations, and analytical choices\n\n5.2 Discussion shall be provided in the context of the relevant short-, medium-, and long-term horizons.\n\n6 The entity shall describe how outputs of catastrophe models inform its underwriting decisions.\n\n6.1 Discussion shall include, but is not limited to:\n\n6.1.1 Development of insurance and reinsurance products which take into account climate-related risks\n\n6.1.2 Pricing of insurance and reinsurance policies\n\n6.1.3 Client selection (i.e., type of events the entity chooses to cover or not and/or geographic markets in which the entity chooses not to underwrite policies)\n\n6.1.4 Cedent selection (i.e., decisions on the amount of risk the entity chooses to transfer through reinsurance)\n\n6.2 Discussion shall be provided in the context of the relevant short-, medium-, and long-term horizons."}
