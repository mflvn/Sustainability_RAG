{"page_number": 165, "text_content": "2 Benefits and claims incurred shall be disclosed in accordance with IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.\n\n3 The entity shall break down the policy losses and benefits expenses for modeled and non-modeled natural peril catastrophe events.\n\n3.1 Modeled natural catastrophes are typically large-scale events, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, that the entity has analyzed using a catastrophic risk model.\n\n3.2 Non-modeled events are typically smaller-scale events, such as floods, droughts, snowstorms, and tornados, that the entity has not analyzed using a catastrophic model (CAT model).\n\n3.2.1 CAT models are probabilistic mathematical models that simulate hazardous events and estimate the associated potential damages and insured losses. They may be conducted by the entity or by a third party on behalf of the entity.\n\n4 The entity shall break down the policy losses and benefits expenses by geographic segment.\n\n5 The entity shall break down the policy losses and benefits expenses by natural peril catastrophe events.\n\n5.1 Where relevant, natural peril catastrophe events include: hurricanes (typhoons), tornadoes, tsunamis, floods, droughts, extreme heat, and winter weather.\n\n6 The entity shall report the policy losses and benefits expenses on a gross and net of catastrophe reinsurance base.\n\n6.1 The net amount shall be calculated as the gross amount of policy losses and benefits expenses from natural peril catastrophe events minus the recoverables from ceded reinsurance.\n\n7 The entity shall consider IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts a normative reference, thus any future updates made to it shall be considered updates to this guidance.\n\nNote to FN-IN-450a.2\n\n1 The entity shall discuss its strategy around enhancing catastrophe modeling.\n\n2 The entity shall discuss how climate change-related impacts and variability of weather-related losses impact the cost of reinsurance and the entity's approach to transferring risk through reinsurance.\n\nFN-IN-450a.3. Description of approach to incorporation of environmental risks into (1) the underwriting process for individual contracts and (2) the management of firm-level risks and capital adequacy\n\n1 The entity shall describe its approach to incorporation of environmental risks into both individual policyholder contracts and enterprise-wide assessments of risk."}
