{"page_number": 163, "text_content": "# Physical Risk Exposure\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nCatastrophe losses associated with extreme weather events will continue to have a material, adverse impact on the Insurance industry. The extent of this impact is likely to evolve as climate change increases the frequency and severity of both modeled and non-modeled natural catastrophes, including hurricanes, floods, and droughts. Failure to appropriately understand environmental risks and price them into the underwritten insurance products may result in higher than expected claims on policies. Subsequently, insurance companies that incorporate climate change considerations into their underwriting process for individual contracts as well as the management of firm-level risks and capital adequacy will be better positioned to protect shareholder value. Enhanced disclosure of a company's approach to incorporating these factors, in addition to quantitative data such as the probable maximum loss and total losses attributable to insurance payouts, will provide investors with the information necessary to assess current and future performance on this issue.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFN-IN-450a.1. Probable Maximum Loss (PML) of insured products from weather-related natural catastrophes\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the Probable Maximum Loss (PML) of insured products from natural peril catastrophe events.\n\n1.1 PML is defined as the anticipated value of the largest monetary loss affecting the entity's insurance portfolio that could result from weather-related natural catastrophes and is based on catastrophe modeling and exceedance probability (EP).\n\n1.2 The scope of disclosure by a natural peril catastrophe event includes: hurricanes (typhoons), tornadoes, tsunamis, floods, droughts, extreme heat, and winter weather.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose the PML using, at a minimum, three likelihood of exceedance scenarios: (1) 2% (1-in-50); (2) 1% (1-in-100); (3) 0.4% (1-in-250).\n\n2.1 The entity may disclose additional likelihood of exceedance scenarios.\n\n3 The entity shall provide the PML breakdown by geographic location.\n\n4 The entity shall report the PML amount on gross and net of catastrophe reinsurance bases.\n\n4.1 The gross PML is the gross probable maximum loss for natural peril catastrophe events (prior to reinsurance) for annual aggregate exposure to all risks, including reinstatement premiums for the year following the relevant year based upon the entity's catastrophe model."}
