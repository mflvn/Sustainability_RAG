In managing their investments, insurance entities increasingly need to consider climate-related risks and opportunities, such as those associated with technological innovations and increasing pressure to comply with emerging policy and regulation. Failure to manage these issues could lead to diminished risk-adjusted returns on investment portfolios and limit an entity's ability to meet insurance claims. Measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with investments\u2014a concept commonly referred to as 'financed emissions'\u2014can enhance understanding of exposure to such risks and opportunities and associated transition planning.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFN-IN-1. (1) Gross exposure to carbon-related industries, by industry (2) total gross exposure to all industries, and (3) percentage of total gross exposure to each carbon-related industry\n\n1.
