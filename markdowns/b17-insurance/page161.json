{"page_number": 161, "text_content": "# Policies Designed to Incentivize Responsible Behavior\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nAdvances in technology and the development of new policy products have allowed insurance companies to limit claim payments while encouraging responsible behavior. The industry is subsequently in a unique position to generate positive social and environmental externalities. Insurance companies have the ability to incentivize healthy lifestyles and safe behavior as well as the development of sustainability-related projects and technologies such as those focused on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture. As the renewable energy industry continues to grow, insurance companies may seek related growth opportunities by underwriting insurance in this area. Additionally, such policy clauses that provide incentives through incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors can be used as tools to mitigate risk in the overall underwriting portfolio, which can reduce insurance payouts over the long term. Therefore, disclosure on premiums written related to energy efficiency and low carbon technology as well as discussion of how companies incentivize health, safety, and/or environmentally responsible actions or behaviors would allow investors to assess how insurance companies manage their performance on this topic.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFN-IN-410b.2.
