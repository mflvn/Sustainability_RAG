# Industry Description

The Insurance industry provides both traditional and nontraditional insurance-related products. Traditional policy lines include property, life, casualty, and reinsurance. Nontraditional products include annuities, alternative risk transfers, and financial guarantees. Companies in the insurance industry also engage in proprietary investments. Insurance companies generally operate within a single segment in the industry, e.g., property and casualty, although there are some large insurance companies with diversified operations. Similarly, companies may vary based on the level of their geographic segmentation. While large companies may underwrite insurance premiums in multiple countries, smaller companies generally operate at a national or even local level. Insurance premiums, underwriting revenue, and investment income drive industry growth, while insurance claim payments present the most significant cost and source of uncertainty for profits. Insurance companies provide products and services that enable the transfer, pooling, and sharing of risk necessary for a well-functioning economy. Insurance companies, through their products, can also create a form of moral hazard, lowering incentives to improve underlying behavior and performance, and thus contributing to sustainability impacts. Similar to other financial institutions, insurance companies face risks associated with credit and financial markets. Within the industry, companies that engage in non-traditional or non-insurance activities, including credit default swaps (CDS) protection and debt securities insurance, have been identified by regulators as being more vulnerable to financial market developments, and subsequently, more likely to amplify or contribute to systemic risk. As a result, insurance companies face the potential of being designated as Systemically Important Financial Institutions, thus exposing them to enhanced regulation and oversight.

Note: Accounting metrics for the material sustainability issues associated with the provision of health insurance are outlined in the SASB Managed Care (HC-MC) Industry Standard.

# Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Investment Management

## Topic Summary

Insurance companies are responsible for investing capital to ensure the preservation of premium revenues equivalent to expected policy claim payouts and must be able to maintain this asset-liability parity over the long term. As environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors have increasingly been shown to have a material impact on the performance of corporations and other assets, there is an increasing need for insurance companies to incorporate these factors into the management of their investments. Failure to address these issues could lead to diminished risk-adjusted returns of their portfolios and limit a company's ability to issue claim payments. Companies should therefore enhance disclosure on how ESG factors, including climate change and natural resource constraints, are incorporated into the investment of policy premiums and affect the portfolio risk.

# Policies Designed to Incentivize Responsible Behavior

## Topic Summary

Advances in technology and the development of new policy products have allowed insurance companies to limit claim payments while encouraging responsible behavior. The industry is subsequently in a unique position to generate positive social and environmental externalities. Insurance companies have the ability to incentivize healthy lifestyles and safe behavior as well as the development of sustainability-related projects and technologies such as those focused on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture. As the renewable energy industry continues to grow, insurance companies may seek related growth opportunities by underwriting insurance in this area. Additionally, such policy clauses that provide incentives through incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors can be used as tools to mitigate risk in the overall underwriting portfolio, which can reduce insurance payouts over the long term. Therefore, disclosure on premiums written related to energy efficiency and low carbon technology as well as discussion of how companies incentivize health, safety, and/or environmentally responsible actions or behaviors would allow investors to assess how insurance companies manage their performance on this topic.

## Metrics

FN-IN-410b.2. Discussion of products and/or product features that incentivize health, safety, and/or environmentally responsible actions and/or behaviors

# Physical Risk Exposure

## Topic Summary

Catastrophe losses associated with extreme weather events will continue to have a material, adverse impact on the Insurance industry. The extent of this impact is likely to evolve as climate change increases the frequency and severity of both modeled and non-modeled natural catastrophes, including hurricanes, floods, and droughts. Failure to appropriately understand environmental risks and price them into the underwritten insurance products may result in higher than expected claims on policies. Subsequently, insurance companies that incorporate climate change considerations into their underwriting process for individual contracts as well as the management of firm-level risks and capital adequacy will be better positioned to protect shareholder value. Enhanced disclosure of a company's approach to incorporating these factors, in addition to quantitative data such as the probable maximum loss and total losses attributable to insurance payouts, will provide investors with the information necessary to assess current and future performance on this issue.

## Metrics

2.1 The entity may disclose additional likelihood of exceedance scenarios.

3 The entity shall provide the PML breakdown by geographic location.

4 The entity shall report the PML amount on gross and net of catastrophe reinsurance bases.

# Transition Risk Exposure

## Topic Summary

Insurance companies invest premium revenue to meet insurance claim pay-outs and need to consider asset-liability management. In managing their investments, insurance entities increasingly need to consider climate-related risks and opportunities, such as those associated with technological innovations and increasing pressure to comply with emerging policy and regulation. Failure to manage these issues could lead to diminished risk-adjusted returns on investment portfolios and limit an entity's ability to meet insurance claims. Measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with investments—a concept commonly referred to as 'financed emissions'—can enhance understanding of exposure to such risks and opportunities and associated transition planning.

# FN-IN-5. Description of the methodology used to calculate financed emissions

1. The entity shall describe the methodology used to calculate financed emissions.

    1.1 Financed emissions refers to the portion of gross emissions of an investee attributed to the investments made by the entity to that investee, which falls under Scope 3: category 15 (investments) in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard.

        1.1.1 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets and credits that have reduced or compensated for emissions.

    1.2 The description shall include the method used to attribute the entity's share of emissions in relation to the size of gross exposure.

    1.3 The description shall include the approach to collecting underlying emissions data including its source.

    1.4 The entity shall disclose if the source data has been verified by a third party, where possible.

    1.5 The entity shall describe the use of estimations, proxies or assumptions, where possible.

    1.6 If the entity is unable to include GHG emissions of an investee or counterparty, it shall state the reason for the omission such as, for example, because it is unable to establish a faithful measure.
