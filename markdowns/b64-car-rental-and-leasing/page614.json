{"page_number": 614, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nCompanies in this industry rent or lease passenger vehicles to customers. Car rentals are typically for periods of less than a month, while leases are for a year or more. The industry includes car-sharing business models where rentals are measured hourly and typically include subscription fees. Car rental companies operate out of airport locations, which serve business and leisure travelers, and out of neighborhood locations, which mostly provide repair-shop and weekend rentals. The industry is concentrated, with several dominant market players, who operate globally using a franchise model. The growth of public transit and ride-sharing services in major metropolitan areas may represent a threat to the long-term profitability of the Car Rental & Leasing industry if customers chose to hail rides or take public transit rather than rent vehicles.\n\n---\n\n116 Note to TR-CR-000.B \u2013 The total number of available rental days is the number of 24-hour periods\u2014or portions thereof\u2014that vehicles were offered for rental during the reporting period.\n117 Note to TR-CR-000.C \u2013 The average rental fleet size is the simple average of the maximum number of vehicles available for rental each month during the reporting period."}
