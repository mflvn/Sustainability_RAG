Consumer demand for more efficient vehicles is growing, motivated by both environmental stewardship and the lower operating costs associated with fuel efficiency. In addition to providing fuel-efficient and low-emission fleets, companies in the industry are adapting to changing vehicle needs by providing car-sharing services. In urban settings, car sharing is an attractive alternative to vehicle ownership that reduces congestion and the environmental impacts associated with private ownership of vehicles. By maximizing fleet utilization rates through car-sharing, companies can enhance business efficiency.\n\n## Metrics\n\nTR-CR-410a.1. Rental day-weighted average rental fleet fuel economy, by region\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the average fuel economy of its passenger vehicle rental fleet, weighted for the rental days of each vehicle model during the reporting period, by geographic region.\n\n1.1 The average fuel economy shall be calculated as the rental day-weighted harmonic mean of vehicle fuel efficiency.\n\n1.1.1 The harmonic mean is calculated as the reciprocal of the average of the reciprocals.\n\n1.1.2 Rental day weighting is performed by incorporating into calculations a factor for the fraction of total rental days for which each vehicle model accounted.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose the average fuel economy of its passenger vehicle rental fleet by geographic region.\n\n2.1 Geographic regions are defined as the regions for which the entity conducts segment financial reporting and which are subject to fleet fuel economy, fuel consumption, or emissions standards.\n\n3 Disclosure may be provided in different units for each geographic region, including, but not limited to:\n\n3.1 Grams of CO\u2082 per kilometer (gCO\u2082 / km) for (1) passenger cars and (2) light commercial vehicles in the European Union\n\n3.2 Liters of petrol per kilometer (L / km) for passenger vehicles in Japan\n\n3.3 Miles per gallon (mpg) for (1) domestic passenger cars, (2) imported passenger cars, and (3) light trucks in the U.S. that are subject to Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, where these vehicle categories are defined in U.S. 49 CFR Part 523\n\n3.4 Kilometers per liter (km / L) for passenger vehicles in New Zealand"}
