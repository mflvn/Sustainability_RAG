Certain types of construction projects are significant contributors toward climate change due to the greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted during their use phase. Projects that are likely to contribute to global GHG emissions include those in the oil and gas space and other extractives industries, as well as large buildings. While some infrastructure projects, such as renewable energy projects, are designed to reduce GHG emissions, many types of projects present trade-offs. Mass transit systems, for example, may be direct contributors of GHG emissions while lowering net emissions once the benefits offered by the system are factored in. Several companies in the industry generate a substantial share of revenues and profits from clients in carbon-intensive industries and whose future capital expenditures may be at risk due to evolving climate regulations. Downside risks may manifest through project delays, cancellations, and diminished long-term revenue growth opportunities. On the other hand, companies that specialize in infrastructure projects that contribute to GHG mitigation could develop competitive advantages as they continue to focus on these growing markets. As the industry and its customers continue to operate within an uncertain business environment and face increasing environmental and regulatory requirements, assessing and communicating the risks and opportunities stemming from climate change that are embedded in a company's backlog and future business prospects can be helpful for investors in assessing the overall impact of climate change on the business.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-EN-410b.1. Amount of backlog for (1) hydrocarbon-related projects and (2) renewable energy projects\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of its backlog associated with (1) hydrocarbon-related projects.\n\n1.1 Backlog is defined as the value of projects not completed as of the close of the reporting period (i.e., revenue contractually expected in the future but that has not been recognized), or is defined by the entity, consistent with its existing disclosure of backlog. Backlog may also be referred to as revenue backlog or unsatisfied performance obligations.\n\n1.2 Hydrocarbon-related projects are defined as any type of project directly associated with the hydrocarbon value chain, including, but not limited to: hydrocarbon exploration, extraction, development, production, and/or transportation; hydrocarbon infrastructure services and maintenance; hydrocarbon power generation; and hydrocarbon-related downstream services.\n\n1.2.1 Examples of hydrocarbon-related projects include, but are not limited to: any project directly associated with oil, gas, or coal production; transportation; refining; and fossil fuel-based electricity generation."}
