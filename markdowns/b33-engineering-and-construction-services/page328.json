Once completed, and during their daily use, these projects often consume significant amounts of resources in the form of energy and water (for a discussion on direct environmental impacts from project construction see the Environmental Impacts of Project Development topic). Therefore, the sourcing of construction materials and the everyday use of buildings and infrastructure can contribute to direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, global and/or local resource constraints, water stress, and negative human health outcomes. Client and regulatory pressures to develop a sustainable built environment are contributing to the growth of markets intended to reduce the lifecycle impacts of buildings and infrastructure projects. In response, various international sustainable building and infrastructure certification schemes have been developed to assess, among other aspects, a project's use-phase energy and water efficiency, impacts on human health, and the use of sustainable construction and building materials. As a result, multiple opportunities are being created for industries in the value chain\u2014from suppliers that can provide such materials, to companies in the Engineering & Construction Services industry that can provide sustainability-oriented project design, consulting, and construction services. Such services can provide a competitive advantage and revenue growth opportunities as client demand for economically advantageous sustainable projects increases and related regulations evolve. Companies unable to effectively integrate such considerations into their services may stand to lose market share in the long term.\n\n## Metrics\n\nIF-EN-410a.1. Number of (1) commissioned projects certified to a third-party multi-attribute sustainability standard and (2) active projects seeking such certification\n\n1    The entity shall disclose (1) the number of projects commissioned during the reporting period that were certified to a third-party multi-attribute sustainability standard.\n\n1.1    The scope of third-party multi-attribute sustainability standards is limited to standards or certifications that, at a minimum, address the following aspects of building or infrastructure design and construction:\n\n1.1.1    Energy efficiency;\n\n1.1.2    Water conservation;\n\n1.1.3    Material and resource efficiency; and\n\n1.1.4    Indoor environmental quality.\n\n1.2    Examples of third-party multi-attribute sustainability standards include:\n\n1.2.1    BREEAM\u00ae\n\n1.2.2    Green Globes\u00ae"}
