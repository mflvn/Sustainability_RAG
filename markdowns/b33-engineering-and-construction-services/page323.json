{"text_content": "# Environmental Impacts of Project Development\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nInfrastructure construction projects help improve economic and social development; however, they can also pose risks to the local environment and surrounding communities. Industry activities can disrupt local ecosystems through biodiversity impacts, emissions into the air, water discharges, natural resource consumption, waste generation, and the use of hazardous chemicals. In particular, construction companies perform clearing, grading, and excavation activities and may generate harmful waste during project construction. Effectively assessing environmental impacts prior to construction may help mitigate unforeseen issues that can raise operational and capital costs. In some cases, environmental concerns and/or local community pushback can result in project delays and, in extreme cases, project cancellations, which may impact a company's profitability and growth opportunities. A failure to comply with environmental regulations during construction can result in costly fines and remediation costs, and can damage a company's reputation. Environmental impact assessments can provide an understanding of a project's potential environmental impacts and the mitigation activities that may be necessary before it begins. Likewise, proper management of environmental risks during project construction can reduce regulatory oversight and/or community pushback. By assessing environmental considerations up front, as well as continuing to evaluate them during project development, engineering and construction companies may be better prepared to mitigate the potential environmental issues and financial risks that may occur, while also establishing a competitive advantage for obtaining new contracts with prospective clients.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-EN-160a.1. Number of incidents of non-compliance with environmental permits, standards, and regulations\n\n1. The entity shall disclose the total number of instances of non-compliance associated with the environment, including, but not limited to, violations of permits, standards, and/or regulations associated with waste, air quality and/or emissions, water discharges, water withdrawal exceedances, effluent limit exceedances (such as waste load allocation), violation of wastewater pretreatment requirements, oil or hazardous substance spills, land use, and endangered species.\n\n2. The scope of disclosure includes incidents governed by national, state, and local statutory permits and regulations.\n\n3. The scope of disclosure includes incidents of non-compliance received by the entity and by subcontractors under the entity's direct supervision.\n\n4. An incident of non-compliance shall be disclosed regardless of whether it resulted in an enforcement action (e.g., fine and/or warning letter).\n\n5. An incident of non-compliance, regardless of the measurement methodology or frequency, shall be disclosed. These include violations for one-time violations, continuous discharges, and non-continuous discharges.", "page_number": 323}
