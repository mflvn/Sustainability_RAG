{"page_number": 333, "text_content": "1.3 Hydrocarbon-related projects are defined as any type of project directly associated with the hydrocarbon value chain, including, but not limited to: hydrocarbon exploration, extraction, development, production, and/or transportation; hydrocarbon infrastructure services and maintenance; hydrocarbon power generation; and hydrocarbon-related downstream services.\n\n1.3.1 Examples of hydrocarbon-related projects include, but are not limited to: any project directly associated with oil, gas, or coal production; transportation; refining; and fossil fuel-based electricity generation.\n\n2 The scope of disclosure is limited to projects where the entity provided engineering, architecture, design, construction, installation, planning, consulting, repair, and/or maintenance services, or other similar services.\n\n3 The entity may discuss specific backlog cancellations, including the root cause and corrective actions taken to prevent future backlog cancellations.\n\nIF-EN-410b.3. Amount of backlog for non-energy projects associated with climate change mitigation\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of its backlog for non-energy projects associated with climate change mitigation.\n\n1.1 Backlog is defined as the value of projects not completed as of the close of the reporting period (i.e., revenue contractually expected in the future but that has not been recognized), or is defined by the entity, consistent with its existing disclosure of backlog. Backlog may also be referred to as revenue backlog or unsatisfied performance obligations.\n\n1.2 Non-energy projects are defined as projects that are not directly associated with the energy value, where the energy value chain includes, but is not limited to: hydrocarbon exploration, extraction, development, production, and transportation; power generation projects (hydrocarbon and renewable); and energy infrastructure services and maintenance.\n\n1.3 Climate change mitigation is defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as an anthropogenic intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases (GHG).\n\n2 The scope of disclosure shall only include projects that are significantly motivated by, or undertaken in response to, climate change mitigation. Such climate change mitigation is not required to be the primary project motivation, but it must be a significant motivating factor for project development and implementation.\n\n2.1 Examples of projects that may be associated with climate change mitigation include, but are not limited to: mass transportation systems; alternative, low-carbon transportation systems; carbon capture and storage; hydrocarbon-related decommissioning projects; and energy efficiency infrastructure retrocommissionings."}
