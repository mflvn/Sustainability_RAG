{"page_number": 332, "text_content": "2 If a significant portion of the entity's backlog in hydrocarbon-related projects is associated with natural gas power generation projects, the entity may provide supplemental disclosures describing this proportion of backlog and the sustainability impacts of such projects relative to alternatives or baseline scenarios.\n\n3 The entity may provide a description of the sustainability implications of hydrocarbon-related projects, including, but not limited to, project descriptions, categorizations by resource type, expected sustainability impacts, and risks related to project completion and/or conversion to revenue.\n\n4 The entity shall disclose the amount of its backlog associated with (2) renewable energy projects.\n\n4.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.\n\n5 The entity shall exclude from its calculations and disclosures of backlog any amount of an order backlog cancellation that re-enters order backlog during the same reporting period as a result of a project owner's successful re-planning of the project.\n\n6 The scope of disclosure is limited to projects where the entity provided engineering, architecture, design, construction, installation, planning, consulting, repair, and/or maintenance services, or other similar services.\n\nIF-EN-410b.2. Amount of backlog cancellations associated with hydrocarbon-related projects\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of its total backlog associated with hydrocarbon-related projects of any type that was cancelled during the reporting period for any reason.\n\n1.1 Backlog is defined as the value of projects not completed as of the close of the reporting period (i.e., revenue contractually expected in the future but that has not been recognized), or is defined by the entity, consistent with its existing disclosure of backlog. Backlog may also be referred to as revenue backlog or unsatisfied performance obligations.\n\n1.2 Backlog cancellations are defined as the amount of backlog cancelled, reduced, terminated, or deferred such that it no longer meets the definition of backlog, or removed from the backlog for any reason other than conversion to revenue or currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n1.2.1 Backlog cancellations include cancellations that occur for any reason, including, but not limited to, a customer's failure to obtain necessary project permitting or financing, a customer's voluntary project cancellation, and reduction in project scope due to financial constraints.\n\n1.2.2 The scope of backlog cancellations excludes cancellations associated with decommissioning projects."}
