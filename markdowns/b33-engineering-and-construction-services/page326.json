{"text_content": "# Structural Integrity & Safety\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nWhether providing engineering, design, architectural, consulting, inspection, construction, or maintenance services, companies in this industry have a professional responsibility to ensure the safety and integrity of their work. Errors or inadequate quality in the project design phase and construction of buildings or infrastructure can cause significant personal injury, loss of property value, and economic harm. Companies that perform poorly on structural integrity and safety can therefore face potentially high costs due to redesign and/or repair work and legal liabilities, as well as reputational damage that could hurt growth prospects. Moreover, when designing and constructing buildings or infrastructure, companies in the industry must increasingly contemplate potential climate change impacts, which may affect the structural integrity of projects and the safety of the general public. Compliance with minimum applicable codes and standards may not be sufficient for maintaining and growing reputational value (or even mitigating legal liabilities) in certain circumstances, especially if the frequency and severity of climate-change-related events increases as expected. Meeting or exceeding new industry standards for quality and establishing internal control procedures to address potential design issues, including those resulting from climate risks, are practices that can help companies reduce these risks.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-EN-250a.1.
