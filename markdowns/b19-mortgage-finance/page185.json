Specifically, hurricanes, floods, and other climate change-related events have the potential to lead to missed payments and loan defaults, while also decreasing the value of underlying assets. Disclosure of overall exposure, loan forgiveness programs, and the incorporation of climate change into lending analysis will allow shareholders to determine which mortgage finance firms are best positioned to protect value in light of environmental risks.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFN-MF-450a.1.
