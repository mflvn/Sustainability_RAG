# Industry Description

The Mortgage Finance industry provides an essential public good in enabling consumers to purchase homes, and contributes to the overall home ownership rate. Companies in the industry lend capital to individual and commercial customers with property as collateral. The primary products are residential and commercial mortgages, while other services offered include: mortgage servicing, title insurance, closing and settlement services, and valuation. In addition, mortgage finance firms own, manage, and finance real estate related investments such as mortgage pass-through certificates and collateralized mortgage obligations. Recent trends in the regulatory environment indicate a significant shift toward consumer protection, disclosure, and accountability. Legislation passed in response to the 2008 mortgage crisis demonstrates the potential for further alignment between the interests of society and those of long-term investors.

# Environmental Risk to Mortgaged Properties

## Topic Summary

An increase in the frequency of extreme weather events associated with climate change may have an adverse impact on the Mortgage Finance industry. Specifically, hurricanes, floods, and other climate change-related events have the potential to lead to missed payments and loan defaults, while also decreasing the value of underlying assets. Disclosure of overall exposure, loan forgiveness programs, and the incorporation of climate change into lending analysis will allow shareholders to determine which mortgage finance firms are best positioned to protect value in light of environmental risks.

## Metrics

FN-MF-450a.1. (1) Number and (2) value of mortgage loans in 100-year flood zones

1. The entity shall disclose the (1) number and (2) value of mortgage loans in the entity's portfolio underwritten on properties that are located in 100-year flood zones.

   1.1 100-year flood zones are defined as land areas subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Such areas may also be referred to as being subject to the one-percent annual chance flood, the one-percent annual exceedance probability flood, or the 100-year flood.

      1.1.1 Examples of 100-year flood zones may include, but are not limited to, coastal flood plains, flood plains along major rivers, and areas subject to flooding from ponding in low-lying areas.

[Note: The crossed-out sections 1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.3, and 1.4 have been excluded as per your instructions.]

2 The scope of disclosure shall include all of the entity's mortgage loans underwritten on properties that are located in 100-year flood zones, regardless of the country of their location.

2.1 The scope of mortgage loans shall include those first mortgages (1-4 family) and junior lien (1-4 family second mortgages or home equity lines of credit) loans that the entity holds as loan assets.

2.2 The scope of mortgage loans shall exclude mortgages held for sale, mortgage-backed securities, and mortgages serviced by the entity.

FN-MF-450a.2. (1) Total expected loss and (2) Loss Given Default (LGD) attributable to mortgage loan default and delinquency due to weather-related natural catastrophes, by geographic region

1 The entity shall disclose the (1) total expected loss and (2) Loss Given Default (LGD), as a percentage, attributable to mortgage loan default and delinquency due to weather-related natural catastrophes.

1.1 Expected loss is defined and calculated as the sum of the values of all the possible losses for the entity's mortgage loans, each multiplied by the probability of that loss occurring.

1.2 LGD is defined as the share of an asset lost in the situation of default.

1.3 Weather-related natural catastrophes include:

1.3.1 Meteorological events (e.g., hurricanes and storms)

1.3.2 Hydrological events (floods)

1.3.3 Climatological events (e.g., heat waves, cold waves, droughts, and wildfires)

1.4 Weather-related natural catastrophes exclude geophysical events (e.g., earthquakes and volcanic eruptions)

2 The entity shall break down its disclosure by geographic region.

2.1 Applicable regions are determined by the entity.

FN-MF-450a.3. Description of how climate change and other environmental risks are incorporated into mortgage origination and underwriting

1 The entity shall describe how it has incorporated climate change and other environmental risks into its mortgage origination and underwriting processes.

1.1 The mortgage origination process is defined broadly as all the steps in a mortgage transaction between a lender and a borrower, including, but not limited to, application, processing, and underwriting.

1.2 The scope of climate change and other environmental risks includes, but is not limited to:

#### Page 187

1.2.1 The increased frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes, including meteorological events (e.g., hurricanes and storms), hydrological events (floods), and climatological events (e.g., heat waves, cold waves, droughts, and wildfires).

1.2.2 The occurrence of geophysical events (e.g., earthquakes and volcanic eruptions).

2 The entity shall disclose how and if these risks affect its origination models and decisions.

2.1 The scope of disclosure includes, but is not limited to:

2.1.1 How the risk impacts the valuation of collateral, such as accounting for inherent risks due to location or assessing for the implementation of basic adaptive measures (e.g., reinforcement, hurricane shutters).

2.1.2 How natural disaster risks affect credit risk analysis, including if the entity assumes that increases in natural disaster frequency and severity will increase the likelihood of default due to properties being un-insured or under-insured.
