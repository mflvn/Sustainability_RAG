{"page_number": 388, "text_content": "# Climate Change Adaptation\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nClimate change affects companies in the industry via frequent or high-impact extreme weather events and changing climate patterns. The manner in which a company's business model is structured to incorporate ongoing assessments of climate change risks, and the adaptation to such risks, is likely to be increasingly connected to company value over the long term. More specifically, investment strategies with assets located on floodplains and in coastal regions that are exposed to inclement weather may have increased needs around risk mitigation and business model adaptation to climate change over the long term. These strategies are especially important in light of the long-term challenges associated with flood insurance rates, the financial stability of government-subsidized flood insurance programs, and financing stipulations or other creditor concerns. Besides insurance, other risk mitigation measures include improvements to physical asset resiliency and lease terms that transfer risk to tenants, although these measures can create their own costs and risks for real estate companies. To ensure long-term growth and protection of shareholder value, companies need to implement climate change adaptation strategies that are comprehensive, account for trade-offs between various risk mitigation strategies, and integrate consideration of all projected costs and benefits over the long term.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-RE-450a.1.
