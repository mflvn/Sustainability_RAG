Typically this is data that is not within the participants' immediate control.\"\n\n9.6 Managed Assets and Indirectly Managed Assets are defined as follows: \"This definition of Managed assets and the definition of Indirectly Managed assets are solely based on the landlord/tenant relationship. [Managed and Indirectly Managed Assets are] assets or buildings for which the landlord is determined to have 'operational control' where operational control is defined as having the ability to introduce and implement operating and/or environmental policies and measures. In case both the landlord and tenant have the authority to introduce and implement any or all of the policies mentioned above, the asset or building should be reported as a Managed asset. Where a single tenant has the sole authority to introduce and implement operating and/or environmental policies and measures, the tenant should be assumed to have operational control, so it should be considered to be an Indirectly Managed asset.\"\n\n10 The entity shall consider the 2018 GRESB Real Estate Assessment Reference Guide as a normative reference, thus any updates made year-on-year shall be considered updates to this guidance.\n\nIF-RE-140a.4.
