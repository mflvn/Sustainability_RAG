For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose energy consumption data coverage separately for each property type in its portfolio, where properties are classified into sectors that are aligned with the FTSE EPRA Nareit Global Real Estate Index property sector classification system.\n\n3 The entity may discuss the comprehensiveness of data coverage if there are coverage variations by energy type. For example, if a portion of floor area consumes electricity and natural gas and the entity has energy consumption data coverage for electricity but not natural gas, the entity does not have complete energy consumption data coverage. However, the entity may disclose the portion of total portfolio gross floor area with partial energy consumption data coverage.\n\n4 The entity may describe the variations in energy consumption data coverage, including the factors that influence it.\n\n4.1 Variations in energy consumption data coverage may occur based on distinctions including, but not limited to:\n\n4.1.1 Base Building, Tenant Space, and Whole Building\n\n4.1.2 Energy Purchased by the Landlord and energy Purchased by Tenants\n\n4.1.3 Managed Assets and Indirectly Managed Assets\n\n4.1.4 Geographical markets"}
