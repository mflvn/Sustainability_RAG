The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and strategies for energy management are highly dependent on the real estate asset class, among other factors. Generally, grid electricity consumption is the predominant form of consumed energy, though on-site fuel combustion and renewable energy production also serve an important roles. Energy costs may be borne by companies in the industry and/or the property occupants; either way, energy management is a significant industry issue. To the extent that the real estate owner assumes direct responsibility for energy costs, such costs often represent significant operating costs, inherently indicating the importance of energy management. Energy pricing volatility and a general trend of electricity price increases, energy-related regulations, wide variations in energy performance across the existing building stock, and opportunities for efficiency improvements through economically attractive capital investments all further point to the importance of energy management. Energy costs assumed by occupants, either in whole or in part, are nonetheless likely to significantly impact companies in the industry, albeit through differing channels. Building energy performance is a notable driver of tenant demand, as it allows them to control operating costs, mitigate the environmental impacts of operations, and, often just as importantly, maintain a reputation for resource conservation. Additionally, real estate owners may be exposed to energy-related regulations even when energy costs are the responsibility of occupants. Overall, companies in the industry that effectively manage the energy performance of their assets may see reduced operating costs and regulatory risks, as well as increased tenant demand, rental rates, and occupancy rates\u2014all of which drive revenue and asset value appreciation. Improving the energy performance of assets is highly dependent on property type and location, target tenant market, local building codes, physical and legal opportunities to deploy distributed renewable energy, ability to measure consumption, and performance of existing building stock, among other factors.\n\n## Metrics\n\nIF-RE-130a.1. Energy consumption data coverage as a percentage of total floor area, by property subsector\n\n1    The entity shall disclose the percentage of its portfolio, based on total gross floor area, with complete energy consumption data coverage.\n\n1.1    Gross floor area is defined as \"the total property square footage, measured between the principal exterior surfaces of the enclosing fixed walls of the building(s).\"\n\n1.1.1    Leasable floor area may be used in place of gross floor area when gross floor area is not available for the relevant area of the portfolio (e.g., a building with an unknown gross floor but a known leasable floor area)."}
