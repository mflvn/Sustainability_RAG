{"page_number": 357, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Real Estate industry is composed of companies that own, develop, and generally operate income-producing real estate assets. Companies in this industry are commonly structured as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and operate in a wide range of segments within the real estate industry, including residential, retail, office, health care, industrial, and hotel properties. REITs typically focus on the direct ownership of real estate assets, thereby providing investors with the opportunity to obtain real estate exposure without direct asset ownership and management. Although REITs are often concentrated in one segment of the Real Estate industry, many REITs are diversified through investment in multiple property types."}
