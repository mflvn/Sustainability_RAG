While companies in the industry own real estate assets, it is the tenant operations of such assets that is a dominant driver of sustainability impacts produced by the built environment. Tenants may design and construct leased spaces according to their operating needs. In turn, their operations consume significant amounts of energy and water, generate waste, and impact the health of those living, working, shopping, or visiting the properties. While these sustainability impacts are often generated by tenant operations and activities, real estate owners have an important role in influencing tenant sustainability impacts. The manner in which companies in the industry structure their agreements, contracts, and relationships with tenants is instrumental in effectively managing the sustainability impacts of their tenants, and ultimately, the impacts of their assets. Managing tenant sustainability impacts may include mitigating the problem of split incentives by aligning both parties' financial interests with sustainability outcomes, establishing systematic measurement and communication of resource consumption data, creating shared performance goals, and mandating minimum sustainability performance or design requirements, among other strategies. Effective management of tenant sustainability impacts, particularly related to energy, water, and indoor environmental quality, may drive asset value appreciation, increase tenant demand and satisfaction, decrease direct operating costs, and/or decrease risks related to building codes and regulations.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-RE-410a.1. (1) Percentage of new leases that contain a cost recovery clause for resource efficiency-related capital improvements and (2) associated leased floor area, by property subsector\n\n1 The entity shall disclose (1) the percentage of new leases that contain a cost recovery clause for resource efficiency-related capital improvements.\n\n1.1 A cost recovery clause for resource efficiency-related capital improvements is defined as a clause in a lease agreement that allows the entity to invest in capital improvements to the energy efficiency and/or water efficiency of properties, while recovering all or a proportion of associated expenditures from tenants, regardless of the mechanism of cost recovery. This definition is generally aligned with:\n\n1.1.1 The Green Lease Leaders application: \"Tenant cost recovery clause that can be used for energy efficiency-related capital improvements. This typically means that the list of operating expenses is expanded to include capital expenses intended to save energy, with the annual pass-through amount most often determined either by an amortization schedule or projected savings.\""}
