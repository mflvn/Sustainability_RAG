# Industry Description

The Real Estate industry is composed of companies that own, develop, and generally operate income-producing real estate assets. Companies in this industry are commonly structured as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and operate in a wide range of segments within the real estate industry, including residential, retail, office, health care, industrial, and hotel properties. REITs typically focus on the direct ownership of real estate assets, thereby providing investors with the opportunity to obtain real estate exposure without direct asset ownership and management. Although REITs are often concentrated in one segment of the Real Estate industry, many REITs are diversified through investment in multiple property types.

#### Page 358

51 Note to IF-RE-000.A – Number of assets shall include the number of distinct real estate property or building assets and is aligned with the 2018 GRESB Real Estate Assessment Reference Guide. Number of assets shall be disclosed separately for each portion of the entity's portfolio where properties are classified into subsectors that are aligned with the FTSE Nareit Classification Structure. The total number of assets reported across all subsectors can exceed the actual number of assets due to the fact that mixed-use assets can be reported in multiple subsectors.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Real estate assets consume significant amounts of energy, primarily related to space heating, ventilating, air conditioning, water heating, lighting, and the use of equipment and appliances. The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and strategies for energy management are highly dependent on the real estate asset class, among other factors. Generally, grid electricity consumption is the predominant form of consumed energy, though on-site fuel combustion and renewable energy production also serve an important roles. Energy costs may be borne by companies in the industry and/or the property occupants; either way, energy management is a significant industry issue. To the extent that the real estate owner assumes direct responsibility for energy costs, such costs often represent significant operating costs, inherently indicating the importance of energy management. Energy pricing volatility and a general trend of electricity price increases, energy-related regulations, wide variations in energy performance across the existing building stock, and opportunities for efficiency improvements through economically attractive capital investments all further point to the importance of energy management. Energy costs assumed by occupants, either in whole or in part, are nonetheless likely to significantly impact companies in the industry, albeit through differing channels. Building energy performance is a notable driver of tenant demand, as it allows them to control operating costs, mitigate the environmental impacts of operations, and, often just as importantly, maintain a reputation for resource conservation. Additionally, real estate owners may be exposed to energy-related regulations even when energy costs are the responsibility of occupants. Overall, companies in the industry that effectively manage the energy performance of their assets may see reduced operating costs and regulatory risks, as well as increased tenant demand, rental rates, and occupancy rates—all of which drive revenue and asset value appreciation. Improving the energy performance of assets is highly dependent on property type and location, target tenant market, local building codes, physical and legal opportunities to deploy distributed renewable energy, ability to measure consumption, and performance of existing building stock, among other factors.

## Metrics

IF-RE-130a.1. Energy consumption data coverage as a percentage of total floor area, by property subsector

1    The entity shall disclose the percentage of its portfolio, based on total gross floor area, with complete energy consumption data coverage.

1.1    Gross floor area is defined as "the total property square footage, measured between the principal exterior surfaces of the enclosing fixed walls of the building(s)."

1.1.1    Leasable floor area may be used in place of gross floor area when gross floor area is not available for the relevant area of the portfolio (e.g., a building with an unknown gross floor but a known leasable floor area).

#### Page 361

1.1.2 Number of units may be used in place of floor area in the Apartments and Lodging/Resorts property subsectors.

1.2 Floor area is considered to have complete energy consumption data coverage when energy consumption data (i.e., energy types and amounts consumed) is obtained by the entity for all types of energy consumed in the relevant floor area during the reporting period, regardless of when such data was obtained.

1.2.1 If such data is not available for one or more types of energy consumed, the relevant floor area shall not be considered to have complete energy consumption data coverage.

1.3 The percentage shall be calculated as the portfolio gross floor area with complete energy consumption data coverage divided by the total portfolio gross floor area for which energy is used.

1.4 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and its tenants, and energy produced by the entity or its tenants (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

2 The entity shall disclose energy consumption data coverage separately for each property type in its portfolio, where properties are classified into sectors that are aligned with the FTSE EPRA Nareit Global Real Estate Index property sector classification system.

3 The entity may discuss the comprehensiveness of data coverage if there are coverage variations by energy type. For example, if a portion of floor area consumes electricity and natural gas and the entity has energy consumption data coverage for electricity but not natural gas, the entity does not have complete energy consumption data coverage. However, the entity may disclose the portion of total portfolio gross floor area with partial energy consumption data coverage.

4 The entity may describe the variations in energy consumption data coverage, including the factors that influence it.

4.1 Variations in energy consumption data coverage may occur based on distinctions including, but not limited to:

4.1.1 Base Building, Tenant Space, and Whole Building

4.1.2 Energy Purchased by the Landlord and energy Purchased by Tenants

4.1.3 Managed Assets and Indirectly Managed Assets

4.1.4 Geographical markets

#### Page 362

4.2    Relevant factors that influence energy consumption data coverage may include, but are not limited to:

4.2.1    Geographical markets and the applicable enabling or inhibiting laws, regulations, and policies within such markets, including those policies of utilities

4.2.2    Administrative or logistical barriers to obtaining energy consumption data (e.g., lack of integration of utilities' data reporting systems)

4.2.3    Tenant demands around the privacy or proprietary nature of energy consumption data

4.2.4    Property subsectors or other more nuanced classifications of property types

4.2.5    Lease structures, including the length in time of leases, the terms applicable to the access of energy consumption data by the entity, and the ability of the entity to influence energy management performance of Tenant Spaces

4.2.6    The entity's perception that its obtainment of Tenant Space energy consumption data may negatively impact tenant demand

5    The following terms are defined according to the 2018 GRESB Real Estate Assessment Reference Guide:

5.1    Base Building is defined as "Energy consumed in supplying central building services to lettable/leasable areas and common areas."

5.2    Tenant Space is defined as "Lettable floor area (both vacant and let/leased areas) that is or can be occupied by tenants."

5.3    Whole Building is defined as "Energy used by tenants and Base Building services to lettable/leasable and common spaces. This should include all energy supplied to the building for the operation of the building and the tenant space."

5.4    Purchased by Landlord is defined as "Energy purchased by the landlord, but consumed by the tenant. This can include energy purchased by the landlord but used for vacant space."

5.5    Purchased by Tenant is defined as "Energy purchased by the tenant. Typically this is data that is not within the participants' immediate control."

5.6    Managed Assets and Indirectly Managed Assets are defined as follows: "This definition of Managed assets and the definition of Indirectly Managed assets are solely based on the landlord/tenant relationship. [Managed and Indirectly Managed Assets are] assets or buildings for which the landlord is determined to have 'operational control' where operational control is defined as having the ability to introduce and implement operating and/or environmental policies and measures. In case both the landlord and tenant have the authority to introduce and implement any or

#### Page 363

all of the policies mentioned above, the asset or building should be reported as a Managed asset. Where a single tenant has the sole authority to introduce and implement operating and/or environmental policies and measures, the tenant should be assumed to have operational control, so it should be considered to be an Indirectly Managed asset."

6 The entity shall consider the 2018 GRESB Real Estate Assessment Reference Guide as a normative reference, thus any updates made year-on-year shall be considered updates to this guidance.

IF-RE-130a.2. (1) Total energy consumed by portfolio area with data coverage, (2) percentage grid electricity, and (3) percentage renewable, by property subsector

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Buildings consume significant amounts of water in their operations, through water fixtures, building equipment, appliances, and irrigation. Operating costs resulting from water consumption may represent significant costs depending on property type, tenant operations, geographical locations, and other factors. Companies in the industry can be responsible for a building's water costs, or common area water costs, though it is common to allocate all, or a portion, of these costs to occupants. In these arrangements, water management continues to play an important role through tenant demand and regulatory exposure. Tenants may assess the water efficiency of real estate assets in an effort to control operating costs, mitigate environmental impacts of operations, and, often just as importantly, develop a reputation for resource conservation. Additionally, real estate owners may be exposed to water-related regulations even when water costs are the responsibility of occupants. Overall, companies in the industry that effectively manage water efficiency of assets, even when they don't face direct exposure to water costs, may see reduced operating costs and regulatory exposure, as well as increased tenant demand, rental rates, and occupancy rates—all of which drive revenue and asset value appreciation. Long-term historic increases in the costs of water—and expectations of continued increases due to overconsumption and constrained supplies resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution, and climate change—indicate the heightened importance of water management. The ability to improve asset water efficiency is highly dependent on the property type, locational water availability, target tenant market, local building codes, the ability to measure consumption, and the level of current efficiency of existing building stock, among other factors.

# Management of Tenant Sustainability Impacts

## Topic Summary

Real estate assets generate significant sustainability impacts, including resource consumption—namely energy and water—waste generation, and impacts on occupant health through indoor environmental quality. While companies in the industry own real estate assets, it is the tenant operations of such assets that is a dominant driver of sustainability impacts produced by the built environment. Tenants may design and construct leased spaces according to their operating needs. In turn, their operations consume significant amounts of energy and water, generate waste, and impact the health of those living, working, shopping, or visiting the properties. While these sustainability impacts are often generated by tenant operations and activities, real estate owners have an important role in influencing tenant sustainability impacts. The manner in which companies in the industry structure their agreements, contracts, and relationships with tenants is instrumental in effectively managing the sustainability impacts of their tenants, and ultimately, the impacts of their assets. Managing tenant sustainability impacts may include mitigating the problem of split incentives by aligning both parties' financial interests with sustainability outcomes, establishing systematic measurement and communication of resource consumption data, creating shared performance goals, and mandating minimum sustainability performance or design requirements, among other strategies. Effective management of tenant sustainability impacts, particularly related to energy, water, and indoor environmental quality, may drive asset value appreciation, increase tenant demand and satisfaction, decrease direct operating costs, and/or decrease risks related to building codes and regulations.

# Climate Change Adaptation

## Topic Summary

Climate change affects companies in the industry via frequent or high-impact extreme weather events and changing climate patterns. The manner in which a company's business model is structured to incorporate ongoing assessments of climate change risks, and the adaptation to such risks, is likely to be increasingly connected to company value over the long term. More specifically, investment strategies with assets located on floodplains and in coastal regions that are exposed to inclement weather may have increased needs around risk mitigation and business model adaptation to climate change over the long term. These strategies are especially important in light of the long-term challenges associated with flood insurance rates, the financial stability of government-subsidized flood insurance programs, and financing stipulations or other creditor concerns. Besides insurance, other risk mitigation measures include improvements to physical asset resiliency and lease terms that transfer risk to tenants, although these measures can create their own costs and risks for real estate companies. To ensure long-term growth and protection of shareholder value, companies need to implement climate change adaptation strategies that are comprehensive, account for trade-offs between various risk mitigation strategies, and integrate consideration of all projected costs and benefits over the long term.
