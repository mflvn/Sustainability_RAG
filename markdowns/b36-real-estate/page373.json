Operating costs resulting from water consumption may represent significant costs depending on property type, tenant operations, geographical locations, and other factors. Companies in the industry can be responsible for a building's water costs, or common area water costs, though it is common to allocate all, or a portion, of these costs to occupants. In these arrangements, water management continues to play an important role through tenant demand and regulatory exposure. Tenants may assess the water efficiency of real estate assets in an effort to control operating costs, mitigate environmental impacts of operations, and, often just as importantly, develop a reputation for resource conservation. Additionally, real estate owners may be exposed to water-related regulations even when water costs are the responsibility of occupants. Overall, companies in the industry that effectively manage water efficiency of assets, even when they don't face direct exposure to water costs, may see reduced operating costs and regulatory exposure, as well as increased tenant demand, rental rates, and occupancy rates\u2014all of which drive revenue and asset value appreciation. Long-term historic increases in the costs of water\u2014and expectations of continued increases due to overconsumption and constrained supplies resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution, and climate change\u2014indicate the heightened importance of water management. The ability to improve asset water efficiency is highly dependent on the property type, locational water availability, target tenant market, local building codes, the ability to measure consumption, and the level of current efficiency of existing building stock, among other factors.\n\n## Metrics\n\nIF-RE-140a.1. Water withdrawal data coverage as a percentage of (1) total floor area and (2) floor area in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress, by property subsector\n\n1    The entity shall disclose (1) the percentage of its portfolio, based on total gross floor area, with complete water withdrawal data coverage.\n\n1.1    Gross floor area is defined as \"the total property square footage, measured between the principal exterior surfaces of the enclosing fixed walls of the building(s).\"\n\n1.1.1    Leasable floor area may be used in place of gross floor area when gross floor area is not available for the relevant area of the portfolio (e.g., a building with an unknown gross floor but a known leasable floor area).\n\n1.1.2    Number of units may be used in place of floor area in the Apartments and Lodging/Resorts property subsectors.\n\n1.2    Floor area is considered to have complete water withdrawal data coverage when water withdrawal data (i.e., amounts withdrawn) is obtained by the entity in the relevant floor area during the reporting period, regardless of when such data was obtained."}
