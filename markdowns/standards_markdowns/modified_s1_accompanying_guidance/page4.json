It illustrates aspects of IFRS S1 but is not intended to provide interpretative guidance.\n\n## Primary users\n\n| Term | Definition |\n|------|------------|\n| IG1  | The objective of IFRS S1 is to require an entity to disclose information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of general purpose financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.[^1] |\n\n## Meeting primary users' information needs\n\n| Term | Definition |\n|------|------------|\n| IG2  | Assessing whether information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary users of a specific reporting entity's general purpose financial reports requires that entity to consider the characteristics of those users while also considering the entity's own circumstances. General purpose financial reports include\u2014but are not restricted to\u2014an entity's general purpose financial statements and sustainability-related financial disclosures. |\n| IG3  | Existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors are the primary users to whom general purpose financial reports are directed. General purpose financial reports are prepared for users with a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and who review and analyse the information diligently. However, even well-informed and diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand sustainability-related financial information. |\n| IG4  | General purpose financial reports do not, and cannot, provide all the information that primary users need. Therefore, the entity aims to meet the common information needs of its primary users. It does not aim to address specialised information needs\u2014information needs that are unique to particular users. |\n| IG5  | To meet the common information needs of its primary users, an entity first separately identifies the information needs of one of the three types of primary users\u2014for example, investors (existing and potential). The entity then repeats the assessment for the two remaining types\u2014lenders (existing and potential) and other creditors (existing and potential). The combined information needs identified by these assessments form the set of common information needs that the entity aims to meet. |\n\n[^1]: Throughout IFRS S1, the terms 'primary users' and 'users' are used interchangeably, with the same meaning and refer to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors."}
