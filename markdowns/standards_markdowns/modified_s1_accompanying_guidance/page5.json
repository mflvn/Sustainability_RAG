Some identified information needs will be common to all types of users, but others may be specific to only one or two types. If an entity were to focus only on information needs that are common to all types of primary users, it might exclude information that meets the needs of only one type.\n\n## Use of publicly available information\n\nIG7   Primary users do not source information exclusively from general purpose financial reports. For example, such users might also consider information about the industry an entity operates in; information about the entity's competitors and the state of the economy; and information in the entity's press releases as well as other documents the entity has published. However, the fact that information is publicly available does not relieve an entity of its responsibility to disclose material information about the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital over the short, medium or long term. These risks and opportunities are collectively referred to as 'sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects'.\n\n## Applying sources of guidance\n\nIG8   This guidance suggests possible ways to apply some of the requirements in IFRS S1. It does not specify additional requirements.\n\nIG9   IFRS S1 requires an entity to refer to and consider the applicability of specified sources of guidance. It also specifies sources of guidance an entity is permitted, but not required, to refer to in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures (see paragraphs 54\u201359 and Appendix C of IFRS S1). These sources can inform the identification of:\n\n(a)   sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects; and\n\n(b)   information about those sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is relevant to the decision-making of users of general purpose financial reports and faithfully represents those sustainability-related risks and opportunities.\n\nIG10  Paragraphs IG11\u2013IG27 illustrate how entities can apply sources of guidance in meeting the requirements in IFRS S1. Paragraphs IG11\u2013IG24 focus on the SASB Standards and paragraphs IG25\u2013IG27 focus on the CDSB Framework Application Guidance for Water-related Disclosures and the CDSB Framework Application Guidance for Biodiversity-related Disclosures (collectively referred to as 'CDSB Framework Application Guidance')."}
