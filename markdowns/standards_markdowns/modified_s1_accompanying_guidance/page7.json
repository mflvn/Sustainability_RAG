If so, an\n        entity might need only to refer to the single applicable SASB Standard (see\n        paragraphs IE3\u2013IE8). Other entities might need to refer to and consider the\n        applicability of more than one SASB Standard to help them identify\n        sustainability-related risks and opportunities associated with their activities\n        (see paragraphs IE9\u2013IE15). Such entities might include those with hybrid or\n        complex business models whose activities span a wider array of activities than\n        reflected in any one SASB Standard.\n\n## Disclosure topics\n\nIG17    After identifying the SASB Standard(s) most closely aligned with the entity's\n        activities, an entity next considers the applicability of the disclosure topics\n        contained in the identified SASB Standard(s) to the entity's activities. The\n        disclosure topics describe specific sustainability-related risks and\n        opportunities associated with the activities conducted by entities within a\n        particular industry. These disclosure topics are intended to enable entities to\n        consistently identify sustainability-related risks and opportunities based on\n        their business model and activities.\n\nIG18    For example, an entity that conducts meat, poultry and dairy operations\n        would refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics in the\n        *Meat, Poultry & Dairy* SASB Standard. In considering the applicability of the\n        SASB Standard for this industry, an entity might conclude that the disclosure\n        topics in that SASB Standard are applicable in the entity's circumstances,\n        including disclosure topics such as:\n\n        (a)     food safety; and\n\n        (b)     workforce health & safety.\n\nIG19    Therefore, the entity could use the disclosure topics in this SASB Standard\u2014\n        including, but not limited to the disclosure topics listed in paragraph IG18\u2014to\n        inform its identification of sustainability-related risks and opportunities, in\n        accordance with paragraph 55 of IFRS S1. Specifically, applying those\n        disclosure topics, the entity could explain that a failure to maintain the\n        quality and safety of its product might result in costly recalls, harm the\n        reputation of its brand, lead to fines, reduce its revenues and increase\n        regulatory scrutiny, including the imposition of trade restrictions. The entity\n        could also use the disclosure topics to disclose information required by\n        paragraph 33 of IFRS S1 about how it manages the identified risks, for\n        example, information about the robust workforce safety practices to avoid\n        reputational impairment, costly turnover, low worker morale and\n        productivity, risks associated with potential liability for injuries, associated\n        healthcare and workers' compensation costs.\n\nIG20    An entity could repeat this approach for each of the applicable disclosure\n        topics. The SASB Standards inform the identification of sustainability-related\n        risks and opportunities of a typical entity within a given industry.\n        Consequently, in some cases the SASB Standards might:"}
