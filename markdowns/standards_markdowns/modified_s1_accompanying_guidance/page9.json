For example, in applying the accompanying technical protocols, the hypothetical meat, poultry and dairy entity would disclose information related to workforce health and safety for all of its workers, regardless of their location and type of employment, such as full-time, part-time, direct, contract, executive, labour, salary, hourly or seasonal. The entity might disclose this information to comply with the requirement in paragraph 32(a) of IFRS S1 to describe the effects of workforce health and safety-related risks on its business model and its value chain. Furthermore, the entity might disaggregate this information\u2014for example, by location of operations\u2014to disclose information in accordance with the requirement in paragraph 32(b) of IFRS S1 to describe where in the entity's business model and value chain workforce health and safety-related risks are concentrated. The technical protocols may also serve as criteria against which the disclosed information can be verified.\n\nIG24\n\nThe accompanying technical protocols would also guide the hypothetical entity in supplementing the metrics with appropriate context\u2014for example, a discussion of notable recalls, including information related to the cause, amount, remediation cost, nature (voluntary or involuntary), associated corrective actions and other significant outcomes related to the recall, such as legal proceedings or consumer illness. The entity might disclose this information to comply with the requirements in paragraph 35 of IFRS S1 to disclose quantitative and qualitative information about the current and anticipated financial effects of food safety-related risks on its financial position, performance and cash flows.\n\n# CDSB Framework Application Guidance\n\nIG25\n\nAs set out in IFRS S1, an entity may refer to and consider the applicability of the CDSB Framework Application Guidance in identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects (see paragraph 55 of IFRS S1). In the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, an entity may refer to and consider the applicability of the CDSB Framework Application Guidance in identifying information that is relevant to the decision-making of users of general purpose financial reports and faithfully represents the sustainability-related risk or opportunity (see paragraphs 57\u201358 of IFRS S1).\n\nIG26\n\nThe CDSB Framework Application Guidance can support entities in identifying water- and biodiversity-related risks and opportunities. For example, the CDSB Framework Application Guidance on Biodiversity-related Disclosures identifies potential physical biodiversity-related risks such as reduction in soil fertility, reduction in pollination for crop production and reduced availability of fish stocks. Similarly, the CDSB Framework Application Guidance on Water-related Disclosures identifies potential water-related opportunities such as improved water efficiency, development of new products and services, and conservation and restoration of ecosystems through engagement and collaboration with stakeholders.
