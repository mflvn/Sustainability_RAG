Each SASB Standard contains:\n\n(a)    industry descriptions\u2014which are intended to help entities identify applicable industry guidance by describing the business models, activities and other common features that characterise participation in the industry;\n\n(b)    disclosure topics\u2014which describe specific sustainability-related risks or opportunities associated with the activities conducted by entities within a particular industry;\n\n(c)    metrics\u2014which accompany disclosure topics and are designed to, either individually or as part of a set, provide useful information regarding an entity's performance for a specific disclosure topic;\n\n(d)    technical protocols\u2014which provide guidance on definitions, scope, implementation and presentation of associated metrics; and\n\n(e)    activity metrics\u2014which quantify the scale of specific activities or operations by an entity and are intended for use in conjunction with metrics referred to in paragraph IG12(c) to normalise data and facilitate comparison.\n\nIG13    The disclosure topics and associated metrics in the SASB Standards are not exhaustive. IFRS S1 requires an entity to present fairly all sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects.\n\n## Identifying applicable SASB Standards\n\nIG14    Each SASB Standard includes an industry name and description. The industry names and descriptions are intended to enable an entity to identify the SASB Standard(s) that is likely to be applicable to its business model and associated activities. Industry names may not precisely align with the industry an entity considers itself to be a part of because industries can be classified and defined according to varying conventions. Moreover, there may be activities that are not specifically addressed by a SASB Standard for a particular industry, although it is likely that those activities, or at least similar activities, are addressed in other SASB Standards.\n\nIG15    In order to consider applicable SASB Standards, it is important for an entity to understand the activities that a particular SASB Standard covers. Each SASB Standard summarises the business it covers in an 'Industry Description' section."}
