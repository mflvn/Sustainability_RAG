{"text_content": "# IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\u2014JUNE 2023\n\n## Illustrative Examples\n\nThese examples accompany, but are not part of, IFRS S1. They illustrate aspects of IFRS S1 but are not intended to provide interpretative guidance.\n\nIE1    These examples portray hypothetical situations illustrating how an entity might apply some of the requirements in IFRS S1 on the basis of the limited facts presented. The analysis in each example is not intended to represent the only manner in which the requirements could be applied, nor are the examples intended to apply only to the specific industries illustrated. Although some aspects of the examples may be present in actual fact patterns, an entity should evaluate all of the relevant facts and circumstances of a particular fact pattern when applying IFRS S1.\n\n## SASB Standards\n\nIE2    Examples 1 and 2 illustrate how an entity might apply the requirements related to sources of guidance. Those requirements include:\n\n(a)    to refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics in the SASB Standards (see paragraph 55(a) of IFRS S1);\n\n(b)    to refer to and consider the applicability of the metrics associated with the disclosure topics included in the SASB Standards (see paragraph 58(a) of IFRS S1);\n\n(c)    to identify the specific standards, pronouncements, industry practice and other sources of guidance that the entity has applied in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures, including, if applicable, identifying the disclosure topics in the SASB Standards (see paragraph 59(a) of IFRS S1);\n\n(d)    to identify the industry(s) specified in the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, the SASB Standards or other sources of guidance relating to a particular industry(s) that the entity has applied in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures, including in identifying applicable metrics (see paragraph 59(b) of IFRS S1); and\n\n(e)    to identify the source and metric taken if an entity discloses a metric from a source other than IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (see paragraph 49 of IFRS S1).\n\n## Example 1\u2014An entity with a single line of business\n\nIE3    Entity Y is a regional passenger airline company. In identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect its prospects, Entity Y is required to apply IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards in accordance with paragraph 54 of IFRS S1. In addition to applying IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, Entity Y is required to refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics in the SASB Standards. Entity Y concludes that its business model and activities most closely align with the Airlines SASB Standard.", "page_number": 12}
