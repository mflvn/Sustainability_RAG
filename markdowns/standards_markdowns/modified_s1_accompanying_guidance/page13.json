In addition, Entity Y refers to and considers the applicability of the disclosure topics in the Airlines SASB Standard in accordance with paragraph 55(a) of IFRS S1. Entity Y concludes that all four disclosure topics in the Airlines SASB Standard are applicable to its activities and uses those disclosure topics to inform its identification of sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect its prospects.\n\nIE5    In disclosing information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities, Entity Y applies IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards that specifically apply to its identified sustainability-related risks and opportunities. For example, Entity Y applies IFRS S2 to disclose information about its greenhouse gas emissions. In the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to the sustainability-related risks and opportunities which Entity Y has identified, Entity Y refers to and considers the applicability of the metrics associated with the applicable disclosure topics in the Airlines SASB Standard. Entity Y concludes that applying these metrics will provide information that is relevant to the decision-making of users of general purpose financial reports and faithfully represents the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that it has identified. For example, the metrics associated with the 'Accident & Safety Management' disclosure topic include:\n\n(a)    TR-AL-540a.1\u2014Description of implementation and outcomes of a Safety Management System;\n\n(b)    TR-AL-540a.2\u2014Number of aviation accidents; and\n\n(c)    TR-AL-540a.3\u2014Number of governmental enforcement actions of aviation safety regulations.\n\nIE6    In identifying information to provide, Entity Y considers the applicability of the technical protocols accompanying the metrics. For example, while disclosing a description of the implementation and outcomes of a Safety Management System, Entity Y might describe any actions or measures it has implemented to mitigate any safety risks and hazardous situations that it has identified. These actions or measures include, for example, particular changes in controls, operations, management, processes, products, business partners, training or technology.\n\nIE7    Entity Y is required to apply the requirements relating to 'core content' in IFRS S1. Entity Y considers the disclosure topics, metrics and associated technical protocols in the Airlines SASB Standard when providing information required by IFRS S1, including information relating to strategy and metrics and targets.\n\nIE8    Entity Y discloses that it applied the disclosure topics and metrics in the Airlines SASB Standard in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures, in accordance with paragraphs 49 and 59 of IFRS S1."}
