{"page_number": 14, "text_content": "IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-\nRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\u2014JUNE 2023\n\nExample 2\u2014A large conglomerate with diverse activities\n\nIE9     Entity A is a large conglomerate with diverse activities. Entity A produces\n        electrical and industrial equipment for use in a range of industries. In\n        addition to IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, Entity A is required to\n        refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics in the SASB\n        Standards in identifying its sustainability-related risks and opportunities.\n        Because of the wide-ranging nature of its activities, Entity A begins its\n        consideration of the applicability of the SASB Standards by considering the\n        various sectors into which the SASB Standards are grouped. Entity A conducts\n        activities in industries in the Health Care, Resource Transformation and\n        Infrastructure sectors, and in some cases owns particular parts of its\n        production process rather than relying on suppliers. It also has some activities\n        in the Transportation and Consumer Goods sectors.\n\nIE10    Entity A refers to and considers the applicability of the disclosure topics in the\n        SASB Standards. Entity A concludes that eight SASB Standards are applicable\n        to its business model and activities. Entity A considers the disclosure topics in\n        the eight standards. Although Entity A observes that it engages in activities\n        related to all of those disclosure topics, Entity A concludes that some of those\n        disclosure topics are not applicable in the entity's circumstances. For example,\n        Entity A concludes that the sustainability-related risk or opportunity\n        characterised by a particular disclosure topic could not reasonably be expected\n        to affect its prospects over the short, medium or long term because the\n        disclosure topic relates to activities that are insignificant for the entity.\n\nIE11    Entity A concludes that most of the disclosure topics in the SASB Standards it\n        has considered are applicable to its significant activities. In some cases where\n        it has less significant activities, it finds that only particular disclosure topics in\n        those related industries are applicable. For example, Entity A concludes that\n        most of the disclosure topics that it considered for its transportation and retail\n        businesses are not applicable, due to the relatively small size of these\n        businesses. However, Entity A concludes that incidents related to safety and\n        labour practices in these businesses, although unlikely to have a large effect\n        on its cash flows in the short term, could have a major effect on its reputation\n        over the medium and long term. This reputational risk could affect the\n        performance of its larger businesses, including its ability to attract and retain\n        talent, over a medium- and long-term time horizon, which could be\n        reasonably expected to affect its medium- and long-term cash flows, access to\n        finance and cost of capital. Thus, Entity A considers these topics in identifying\n        sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be\n        expected to affect its prospects."}
