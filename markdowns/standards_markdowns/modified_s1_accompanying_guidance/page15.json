{"page_number": 15, "text_content": "# IFRS S1 ACCOMPANYING GUIDANCE\n\nIE12    In the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that Entity A has identified, Entity A refers to and considers the applicability of the metrics associated with applicable disclosure topics. In identifying applicable metrics, Entity A considers whether the metric will provide information that is relevant to the decision-making of users of general purpose financial reports and that faithfully represents the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that it has identified.\n\nIE13    In preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures, Entity A concludes that some information should be aggregated to avoid obscuring material information with immaterial information. For example, it concludes that information about its strategy for sourcing critical materials for devices produced by its various activities should be aggregated because the entity manages the supplier relationships for those critical materials centrally.\n\nIE14    In contrast, for other types of information, Entity A concludes aggregation would result in obscuring material information. For example, it concludes that information about the number of recalls related to its equipment in the Health Care sector should not be aggregated with information about the number of recalls related to its equipment in the Consumer Goods sector because the technologies, production processes and markets for each sector differ. Therefore, there are also varied reasons for the occurrence of product recalls in these sectors.\n\nIE15    Entity A discloses information about the SASB Standards it has applied in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures, in accordance with paragraphs 49 and 59 of IFRS S1, including identifying the specific SASB Standards, disclosure topics and metrics it applied. Entity A also provides information to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand the judgements that it has made in the process of preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures and that have the most significant effect on the information included in those disclosures in accordance with paragraph 74 of IFRS S1."}
