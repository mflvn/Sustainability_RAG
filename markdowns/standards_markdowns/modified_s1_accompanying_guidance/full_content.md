# IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information

## Illustrative Guidance

This guidance accompanies, but is not part of, IFRS S1. It illustrates aspects of IFRS S1 but is not intended to provide interpretative guidance.

## Primary users

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| IG1  | The objective of IFRS S1 is to require an entity to disclose information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of general purpose financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.[^1] |

## Meeting primary users' information needs

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| IG2  | Assessing whether information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary users of a specific reporting entity's general purpose financial reports requires that entity to consider the characteristics of those users while also considering the entity's own circumstances. General purpose financial reports include—but are not restricted to—an entity's general purpose financial statements and sustainability-related financial disclosures. |
| IG3  | Existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors are the primary users to whom general purpose financial reports are directed. General purpose financial reports are prepared for users with a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and who review and analyse the information diligently. However, even well-informed and diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand sustainability-related financial information. |
| IG4  | General purpose financial reports do not, and cannot, provide all the information that primary users need. Therefore, the entity aims to meet the common information needs of its primary users. It does not aim to address specialised information needs—information needs that are unique to particular users. |
| IG5  | To meet the common information needs of its primary users, an entity first separately identifies the information needs of one of the three types of primary users—for example, investors (existing and potential). The entity then repeats the assessment for the two remaining types—lenders (existing and potential) and other creditors (existing and potential). The combined information needs identified by these assessments form the set of common information needs that the entity aims to meet. |

[^1]: Throughout IFRS S1, the terms 'primary users' and 'users' are used interchangeably, with the same meaning and refer to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors.

# IFRS S1 ACCOMPANYING GUIDANCE

IG6   In other words, the assessment of common information needs does not require an entity to identify the information needs that are shared by all users. Some identified information needs will be common to all types of users, but others may be specific to only one or two types. If an entity were to focus only on information needs that are common to all types of primary users, it might exclude information that meets the needs of only one type.

## Use of publicly available information

IG7   Primary users do not source information exclusively from general purpose financial reports. For example, such users might also consider information about the industry an entity operates in; information about the entity's competitors and the state of the economy; and information in the entity's press releases as well as other documents the entity has published. However, the fact that information is publicly available does not relieve an entity of its responsibility to disclose material information about the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital over the short, medium or long term. These risks and opportunities are collectively referred to as 'sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects'.

## Applying sources of guidance

IG8   This guidance suggests possible ways to apply some of the requirements in IFRS S1. It does not specify additional requirements.

IG9   IFRS S1 requires an entity to refer to and consider the applicability of specified sources of guidance. It also specifies sources of guidance an entity is permitted, but not required, to refer to in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures (see paragraphs 54–59 and Appendix C of IFRS S1). These sources can inform the identification of:

(a)   sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects; and

(b)   information about those sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is relevant to the decision-making of users of general purpose financial reports and faithfully represents those sustainability-related risks and opportunities.

IG10  Paragraphs IG11–IG27 illustrate how entities can apply sources of guidance in meeting the requirements in IFRS S1. Paragraphs IG11–IG24 focus on the SASB Standards and paragraphs IG25–IG27 focus on the CDSB Framework Application Guidance for Water-related Disclosures and the CDSB Framework Application Guidance for Biodiversity-related Disclosures (collectively referred to as 'CDSB Framework Application Guidance').

## SASB Standards

IG11    As set out in IFRS S1, an entity is required to refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics in the SASB Standards in identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects.

IG12    The SASB Standards are organised by industry. Each SASB Standard contains:

(a)    industry descriptions—which are intended to help entities identify applicable industry guidance by describing the business models, activities and other common features that characterise participation in the industry;

(b)    disclosure topics—which describe specific sustainability-related risks or opportunities associated with the activities conducted by entities within a particular industry;

(c)    metrics—which accompany disclosure topics and are designed to, either individually or as part of a set, provide useful information regarding an entity's performance for a specific disclosure topic;

(d)    technical protocols—which provide guidance on definitions, scope, implementation and presentation of associated metrics; and

(e)    activity metrics—which quantify the scale of specific activities or operations by an entity and are intended for use in conjunction with metrics referred to in paragraph IG12(c) to normalise data and facilitate comparison.

IG13    The disclosure topics and associated metrics in the SASB Standards are not exhaustive. IFRS S1 requires an entity to present fairly all sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects.

## Identifying applicable SASB Standards

IG14    Each SASB Standard includes an industry name and description. The industry names and descriptions are intended to enable an entity to identify the SASB Standard(s) that is likely to be applicable to its business model and associated activities. Industry names may not precisely align with the industry an entity considers itself to be a part of because industries can be classified and defined according to varying conventions. Moreover, there may be activities that are not specifically addressed by a SASB Standard for a particular industry, although it is likely that those activities, or at least similar activities, are addressed in other SASB Standards.

IG15    In order to consider applicable SASB Standards, it is important for an entity to understand the activities that a particular SASB Standard covers. Each SASB Standard summarises the business it covers in an 'Industry Description' section.

## Page 7

# IFRS S1 ACCOMPANYING GUIDANCE

IG16    Some entities might find that their business models and activities are closely
        aligned with the industry description of a single SASB Standard. If so, an
        entity might need only to refer to the single applicable SASB Standard (see
        paragraphs IE3–IE8). Other entities might need to refer to and consider the
        applicability of more than one SASB Standard to help them identify
        sustainability-related risks and opportunities associated with their activities
        (see paragraphs IE9–IE15). Such entities might include those with hybrid or
        complex business models whose activities span a wider array of activities than
        reflected in any one SASB Standard.

## Disclosure topics

IG17    After identifying the SASB Standard(s) most closely aligned with the entity's
        activities, an entity next considers the applicability of the disclosure topics
        contained in the identified SASB Standard(s) to the entity's activities. The
        disclosure topics describe specific sustainability-related risks and
        opportunities associated with the activities conducted by entities within a
        particular industry. These disclosure topics are intended to enable entities to
        consistently identify sustainability-related risks and opportunities based on
        their business model and activities.

IG18    For example, an entity that conducts meat, poultry and dairy operations
        would refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics in the
        *Meat, Poultry & Dairy* SASB Standard. In considering the applicability of the
        SASB Standard for this industry, an entity might conclude that the disclosure
        topics in that SASB Standard are applicable in the entity's circumstances,
        including disclosure topics such as:

        (a)     food safety; and

        (b)     workforce health & safety.

IG19    Therefore, the entity could use the disclosure topics in this SASB Standard—
        including, but not limited to the disclosure topics listed in paragraph IG18—to
        inform its identification of sustainability-related risks and opportunities, in
        accordance with paragraph 55 of IFRS S1. Specifically, applying those
        disclosure topics, the entity could explain that a failure to maintain the
        quality and safety of its product might result in costly recalls, harm the
        reputation of its brand, lead to fines, reduce its revenues and increase
        regulatory scrutiny, including the imposition of trade restrictions. The entity
        could also use the disclosure topics to disclose information required by
        paragraph 33 of IFRS S1 about how it manages the identified risks, for
        example, information about the robust workforce safety practices to avoid
        reputational impairment, costly turnover, low worker morale and
        productivity, risks associated with potential liability for injuries, associated
        healthcare and workers' compensation costs.

IG20    An entity could repeat this approach for each of the applicable disclosure
        topics. The SASB Standards inform the identification of sustainability-related
        risks and opportunities of a typical entity within a given industry.
        Consequently, in some cases the SASB Standards might:

## Page 8

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-
RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

(a)    include disclosure topics that would not result in useful information
       for users of general purpose financial reports for every entity within a
       given industry; and

(b)    not include every disclosure topic that would result in useful
       information.

In some cases, an entity might conclude that a disclosure topic would not
result in useful information because of the entity's business model. That
might be the case, for example, if the entity does not engage in activities that
are covered by that disclosure topic. Conversely, an entity might also need to
consider additional sources of guidance specified in paragraph 55(b) of IFRS S1
to identify sustainability-related risks or opportunities that could reasonably
be expected to affect the entity's prospects.

Metrics

IG21    In the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically
        applies to a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, IFRS S1 requires an
        entity to refer to and consider the applicability of the metrics associated with
        the disclosure topics included in the SASB Standards. An entity might
        conclude that metrics specified in the SASB Standards are not applicable in the
        entity's circumstances.

IG22    Hypothetically, a meat, poultry and dairy entity might refer to and consider
        the applicability of the following metrics included in the Meat, Poultry & Dairy
        SASB Standard:

        (a)    food safety:

               (i)     FB-MP-250a.1—Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) audit (1) non-
                       conformance rate and (2) associated corrective action rate for (a)
                       major and (b) minor non-conformances;

               (ii)    FB-MP-250a.2—Percentage of supplier facilities certified to a
                       Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) food safety certification
                       program;

               (iii)   FB-MP-250a.3—(1) Number of recalls issued and (2) total weight
                       of products recalled; and

               (iv)    FB-MP-250a.4—Discussion of markets that ban imports of the
                       entity's products; and

        (b)    workforce health & safety:

               (i)     FB-MP-320a.1—(1) Total recordable incident rate (TRIR) and
                       (2) fatality rate; and

               (ii)    FB-MP-320a.2—Description of efforts to assess, monitor, and
                       mitigate acute and chronic respiratory health conditions.

IG23

Each of these metrics is supported by technical protocols that provide detailed guidance on definitions, scope, implementation and presentation. For example, in applying the accompanying technical protocols, the hypothetical meat, poultry and dairy entity would disclose information related to workforce health and safety for all of its workers, regardless of their location and type of employment, such as full-time, part-time, direct, contract, executive, labour, salary, hourly or seasonal. The entity might disclose this information to comply with the requirement in paragraph 32(a) of IFRS S1 to describe the effects of workforce health and safety-related risks on its business model and its value chain. Furthermore, the entity might disaggregate this information—for example, by location of operations—to disclose information in accordance with the requirement in paragraph 32(b) of IFRS S1 to describe where in the entity's business model and value chain workforce health and safety-related risks are concentrated. The technical protocols may also serve as criteria against which the disclosed information can be verified.

IG24

The accompanying technical protocols would also guide the hypothetical entity in supplementing the metrics with appropriate context—for example, a discussion of notable recalls, including information related to the cause, amount, remediation cost, nature (voluntary or involuntary), associated corrective actions and other significant outcomes related to the recall, such as legal proceedings or consumer illness. The entity might disclose this information to comply with the requirements in paragraph 35 of IFRS S1 to disclose quantitative and qualitative information about the current and anticipated financial effects of food safety-related risks on its financial position, performance and cash flows.

# CDSB Framework Application Guidance

IG25

As set out in IFRS S1, an entity may refer to and consider the applicability of the CDSB Framework Application Guidance in identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects (see paragraph 55 of IFRS S1). In the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, an entity may refer to and consider the applicability of the CDSB Framework Application Guidance in identifying information that is relevant to the decision-making of users of general purpose financial reports and faithfully represents the sustainability-related risk or opportunity (see paragraphs 57–58 of IFRS S1).

IG26

The CDSB Framework Application Guidance can support entities in identifying water- and biodiversity-related risks and opportunities. For example, the CDSB Framework Application Guidance on Biodiversity-related Disclosures identifies potential physical biodiversity-related risks such as reduction in soil fertility, reduction in pollination for crop production and reduced availability of fish stocks. Similarly, the CDSB Framework Application Guidance on Water-related Disclosures identifies potential water-related opportunities such as improved water efficiency, development of new products and services, and conservation and restoration of ecosystems through engagement and collaboration with stakeholders. In applying the requirement in paragraph 21 of IFRS S1 on

## Page 10

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-
RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

connected information, the CDSB Framework Application Guidance explains
how water- and biodiversity-related risks might be connected to other
sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be
expected to affect an entity's prospects; for example, water-related risks, such
as more frequent flooding, are often inherently linked to climate-related risks.

IG27    An entity might have identified water- or biodiversity-related risks and
opportunities in accordance with the SASB Standards, the CDSB Framework
Application Guidance or other sources of guidance in accordance with
paragraph 55 of IFRS S1. In the absence of a specifically applicable IFRS
Sustainability Disclosure Standard, the entity may consider the applicability of
the CDSB Framework Application Guidance in identifying information to be
provided, including metrics, about the water- or biodiversity-related risks or
opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity's prospects.
An entity might consider the CDSB Framework Application Guidance in
applying the core content requirements in paragraphs 25–53 of IFRS S1, for
example:

(a)     Governance—in providing disclosures on governance relating to water-
related risks and opportunities, the CDSB Framework Application
Guidance on Water-related Disclosures suggests an entity might
provide information about how water policies, strategy and
information are delegated to management. In relation to collaboration
with stakeholders to achieve effective water management, the
guidance also suggests an entity might provide information about
whether there are specific bodies, individuals or mechanisms located
in areas that are affected by significant water loss whose function is to
ensure compliance with water-related regulation and engagement with
stakeholders.

(b)     Strategy—in providing disclosures on strategy relating to biodiversity-
related risks and opportunities, the CDSB Framework Application
Guidance on Biodiversity-related Disclosures suggests an entity might
provide, for example, information about the geographic-specificity of
biodiversity-related risks and opportunities and how those risks and
opportunities may vary over the short, medium and long term. The
guidance also suggests the type of quantitative and qualitative
information an entity might consider providing in accordance with
paragraphs 34–40 of IFRS S1, for example, the operational expenses,
cost savings and revenue associated with biodiversity management,
such as information about remediation costs or provisions in the case
of accidents such as polluting spills, costs of staff training and revenue
from biodiversity-efficient products and services.

(c)     Metrics and targets—the CDSB Framework Application Guidance on
Biodiversity-related Disclosures provides examples of common
biodiversity metrics such as concentrations of key pollutants in
wastewater, the volume of timber and non-timber forest products
harvested and areas of forest, grassland or wetland converted due to
urbanisation. Due to changes in biodiversity over time, the guidance
suggests an entity provides information about the time frames it has

## Page 11

# IFRS S1 ACCOMPANYING GUIDANCE

set for targets. The guidance also discusses targets tailored to specific locations due to geographical variation in biodiversity priorities, as well as differing legal and regulatory requirements.

## Illustrative Examples

These examples accompany, but are not part of, IFRS S1. They illustrate aspects of IFRS S1 but are not intended to provide interpretative guidance.

IE1    These examples portray hypothetical situations illustrating how an entity might apply some of the requirements in IFRS S1 on the basis of the limited facts presented. The analysis in each example is not intended to represent the only manner in which the requirements could be applied, nor are the examples intended to apply only to the specific industries illustrated. Although some aspects of the examples may be present in actual fact patterns, an entity should evaluate all of the relevant facts and circumstances of a particular fact pattern when applying IFRS S1.

## SASB Standards

IE2    Examples 1 and 2 illustrate how an entity might apply the requirements related to sources of guidance. Those requirements include:

(a)    to refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics in the SASB Standards (see paragraph 55(a) of IFRS S1);

(b)    to refer to and consider the applicability of the metrics associated with the disclosure topics included in the SASB Standards (see paragraph 58(a) of IFRS S1);

(c)    to identify the specific standards, pronouncements, industry practice and other sources of guidance that the entity has applied in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures, including, if applicable, identifying the disclosure topics in the SASB Standards (see paragraph 59(a) of IFRS S1);

(d)    to identify the industry(s) specified in the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, the SASB Standards or other sources of guidance relating to a particular industry(s) that the entity has applied in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures, including in identifying applicable metrics (see paragraph 59(b) of IFRS S1); and

(e)    to identify the source and metric taken if an entity discloses a metric from a source other than IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (see paragraph 49 of IFRS S1).

## Example 1—An entity with a single line of business

IE3    Entity Y is a regional passenger airline company. In identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect its prospects, Entity Y is required to apply IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards in accordance with paragraph 54 of IFRS S1. In addition to applying IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, Entity Y is required to refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics in the SASB Standards. Entity Y concludes that its business model and activities most closely align with the Airlines SASB Standard.

## Page 13

# IFRS S1 ACCOMPANYING GUIDANCE

IE4    Entity Y applies IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures and identifies climate-related risks or opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect its prospects. In addition, Entity Y refers to and considers the applicability of the disclosure topics in the Airlines SASB Standard in accordance with paragraph 55(a) of IFRS S1. Entity Y concludes that all four disclosure topics in the Airlines SASB Standard are applicable to its activities and uses those disclosure topics to inform its identification of sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect its prospects.

IE5    In disclosing information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities, Entity Y applies IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards that specifically apply to its identified sustainability-related risks and opportunities. For example, Entity Y applies IFRS S2 to disclose information about its greenhouse gas emissions. In the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to the sustainability-related risks and opportunities which Entity Y has identified, Entity Y refers to and considers the applicability of the metrics associated with the applicable disclosure topics in the Airlines SASB Standard. Entity Y concludes that applying these metrics will provide information that is relevant to the decision-making of users of general purpose financial reports and faithfully represents the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that it has identified. For example, the metrics associated with the 'Accident & Safety Management' disclosure topic include:

(a)    TR-AL-540a.1—Description of implementation and outcomes of a Safety Management System;

(b)    TR-AL-540a.2—Number of aviation accidents; and

(c)    TR-AL-540a.3—Number of governmental enforcement actions of aviation safety regulations.

IE6    In identifying information to provide, Entity Y considers the applicability of the technical protocols accompanying the metrics. For example, while disclosing a description of the implementation and outcomes of a Safety Management System, Entity Y might describe any actions or measures it has implemented to mitigate any safety risks and hazardous situations that it has identified. These actions or measures include, for example, particular changes in controls, operations, management, processes, products, business partners, training or technology.

IE7    Entity Y is required to apply the requirements relating to 'core content' in IFRS S1. Entity Y considers the disclosure topics, metrics and associated technical protocols in the Airlines SASB Standard when providing information required by IFRS S1, including information relating to strategy and metrics and targets.

IE8    Entity Y discloses that it applied the disclosure topics and metrics in the Airlines SASB Standard in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures, in accordance with paragraphs 49 and 59 of IFRS S1.

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-
RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

Example 2—A large conglomerate with diverse activities

IE9     Entity A is a large conglomerate with diverse activities. Entity A produces
        electrical and industrial equipment for use in a range of industries. In
        addition to IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, Entity A is required to
        refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics in the SASB
        Standards in identifying its sustainability-related risks and opportunities.
        Because of the wide-ranging nature of its activities, Entity A begins its
        consideration of the applicability of the SASB Standards by considering the
        various sectors into which the SASB Standards are grouped. Entity A conducts
        activities in industries in the Health Care, Resource Transformation and
        Infrastructure sectors, and in some cases owns particular parts of its
        production process rather than relying on suppliers. It also has some activities
        in the Transportation and Consumer Goods sectors.

IE10    Entity A refers to and considers the applicability of the disclosure topics in the
        SASB Standards. Entity A concludes that eight SASB Standards are applicable
        to its business model and activities. Entity A considers the disclosure topics in
        the eight standards. Although Entity A observes that it engages in activities
        related to all of those disclosure topics, Entity A concludes that some of those
        disclosure topics are not applicable in the entity's circumstances. For example,
        Entity A concludes that the sustainability-related risk or opportunity
        characterised by a particular disclosure topic could not reasonably be expected
        to affect its prospects over the short, medium or long term because the
        disclosure topic relates to activities that are insignificant for the entity.

IE11    Entity A concludes that most of the disclosure topics in the SASB Standards it
        has considered are applicable to its significant activities. In some cases where
        it has less significant activities, it finds that only particular disclosure topics in
        those related industries are applicable. For example, Entity A concludes that
        most of the disclosure topics that it considered for its transportation and retail
        businesses are not applicable, due to the relatively small size of these
        businesses. However, Entity A concludes that incidents related to safety and
        labour practices in these businesses, although unlikely to have a large effect
        on its cash flows in the short term, could have a major effect on its reputation
        over the medium and long term. This reputational risk could affect the
        performance of its larger businesses, including its ability to attract and retain
        talent, over a medium- and long-term time horizon, which could be
        reasonably expected to affect its medium- and long-term cash flows, access to
        finance and cost of capital. Thus, Entity A considers these topics in identifying
        sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be
        expected to affect its prospects.

## Page 15

# IFRS S1 ACCOMPANYING GUIDANCE

IE12    In the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that Entity A has identified, Entity A refers to and considers the applicability of the metrics associated with applicable disclosure topics. In identifying applicable metrics, Entity A considers whether the metric will provide information that is relevant to the decision-making of users of general purpose financial reports and that faithfully represents the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that it has identified.

IE13    In preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures, Entity A concludes that some information should be aggregated to avoid obscuring material information with immaterial information. For example, it concludes that information about its strategy for sourcing critical materials for devices produced by its various activities should be aggregated because the entity manages the supplier relationships for those critical materials centrally.

IE14    In contrast, for other types of information, Entity A concludes aggregation would result in obscuring material information. For example, it concludes that information about the number of recalls related to its equipment in the Health Care sector should not be aggregated with information about the number of recalls related to its equipment in the Consumer Goods sector because the technologies, production processes and markets for each sector differ. Therefore, there are also varied reasons for the occurrence of product recalls in these sectors.

IE15    Entity A discloses information about the SASB Standards it has applied in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures, in accordance with paragraphs 49 and 59 of IFRS S1, including identifying the specific SASB Standards, disclosure topics and metrics it applied. Entity A also provides information to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand the judgements that it has made in the process of preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures and that have the most significant effect on the information included in those disclosures in accordance with paragraph 74 of IFRS S1.
