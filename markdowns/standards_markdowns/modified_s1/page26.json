They can be internal\u2014such as the entity's workforce, its know-how or its organisational processes\u2014or they can be external\u2014such as materials and services the entity needs to access or the relationships it has with suppliers, distributors and customers. Furthermore, resources and relationships include, but are not limited to, the resources and relationships recognised as assets in the entity's financial statements.\n\nB5 An entity's dependencies and impacts are not limited to resources the entity engages with directly, and to the entity's direct relationships. Those dependencies and impacts also relate to resources and relationships throughout the entity's value chain. For example, they can relate to the entity's supply and distribution channels; the effects of the consumption and disposal of the entity's products; and the entity's sources of finance and its investments, including investments in associates and joint ventures. If the entity's business partners throughout its value chain face sustainability-related risks and opportunities, the entity could be exposed to related consequences of its own.\n\n## Identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities\n\nB6 An entity shall use all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort (see paragraphs B8\u2013B10):\n\n(a) to identify the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects; and\n\n(b) to determine the scope of its value chain, including its breadth and composition, in relation to each of those sustainability-related risks and opportunities.\n\nB7 In identifying the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect its prospects, an entity shall apply the requirements on sources of guidance in paragraphs 54\u201355.\n\n## Reasonable and supportable information\n\nB8 Reasonable and supportable information used by an entity in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures shall cover factors that are specific to the entity as well as general conditions in the external environment. In some cases\u2014such as in identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity's prospects\u2014reasonable and supportable information includes information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions. Other IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards may specify what is reasonable and supportable information in specific cases."}
