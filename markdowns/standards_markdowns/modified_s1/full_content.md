# IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information

## Objective

1 The objective of IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information is to require an entity to disclose information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of general purpose financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.[^1]

2 Information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities is useful to primary users because an entity's ability to generate cash flows over the short, medium and long term is inextricably linked to the interactions between the entity and its stakeholders, society, the economy and the natural environment throughout the entity's value chain. Together, the entity and the resources and relationships throughout its value chain form an interdependent system in which the entity operates. The entity's dependencies on those resources and relationships and its impacts on those resources and relationships give rise to sustainability-related risks and opportunities for the entity.

3 This Standard requires an entity to disclose information about all sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital over the short, medium or long term. For the purposes of this Standard, these risks and opportunities are collectively referred to as 'sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects'.

4 This Standard also prescribes how an entity prepares and reports its sustainability-related financial disclosures. It sets out general requirements for the content and presentation of those disclosures so that the information disclosed is useful to primary users in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.

## Scope

5 An entity shall apply this Standard in preparing and reporting sustainability-related financial disclosures in accordance with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.

6 Sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could not reasonably be expected to affect an entity's prospects are outside the scope of this Standard.

7 Other IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards specify information an entity is required to disclose about specific sustainability-related risks and opportunities.

[^1]: Throughout this Standard, the terms 'primary users' and 'users' are used interchangeably, with the same meaning.

## Page 7

8 An entity may apply IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards irrespective of whether the entity's related general purpose financial statements (referred to as 'financial statements') are prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards or other generally accepted accounting principles or practices (GAAP).

9 This Standard uses terminology suitable for profit-oriented entities, including public-sector business entities. If entities with not-for-profit activities in the private sector or the public sector apply this Standard, they might need to amend the descriptions used for particular items of information when applying IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.

# Conceptual foundations

10 For sustainability-related financial information to be useful, it must be relevant and faithfully represent what it purports to represent. These are fundamental qualitative characteristics of useful sustainability-related financial information. The usefulness of sustainability-related financial information is enhanced if the information is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable. These are enhancing qualitative characteristics of useful sustainability-related financial information (see Appendix D).

# Fair presentation

11 A complete set of sustainability-related financial disclosures shall present fairly all sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity's prospects.

12 To identify sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity's prospects, an entity shall apply paragraphs B1–B12.

13 Fair presentation requires disclosure of relevant information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects, and their faithful representation in accordance with the principles set out in this Standard. To achieve faithful representation, an entity shall provide a complete, neutral and accurate depiction of those sustainability-related risks and opportunities.

14 Materiality is an entity-specific aspect of relevance based on the nature or magnitude, or both, of the items to which the information relates, in the context of the entity's sustainability-related financial disclosures.

15 Fair presentation also requires an entity:

(a) to disclose information that is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable; and

(b) to disclose additional information if compliance with the specifically applicable requirements in IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards is insufficient to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand the effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities

## Page 8

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-
RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

on the entity's cash flows, its access to finance and cost of capital over
the short, medium and long term.

16 Applying IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, with additional
information disclosed when necessary (see paragraph 15(b)), is presumed to
result in sustainability-related financial disclosures that achieve fair
presentation.

Materiality

17 An entity shall disclose material information about the sustainability-related
risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the
entity's prospects.

18 In the context of sustainability-related financial disclosures, information is
material if omitting, misstating or obscuring that information could
reasonably be expected to influence decisions that primary users of general
purpose financial reports make on the basis of those reports, which
include financial statements and sustainability-related financial disclosures
and which provide information about a specific reporting entity.

19 To identify and disclose material information, an entity shall apply paragraphs
B13–B37.

Reporting entity

20 An entity's sustainability-related financial disclosures shall be for the same
reporting entity as the related financial statements (see paragraph B38).

Connected information

21 An entity shall provide information in a manner that enables users of
general purpose financial reports to understand the following types of
connections:

(a) the connections between the items to which the information relates
—such as connections between various sustainability-related risks
and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the
entity's prospects; and

(b) the connections between disclosures provided by the entity:

(i) within its sustainability-related financial disclosures—such
as connections between disclosures on governance, strategy,
risk management and metrics and targets; and

(ii) across its sustainability-related financial disclosures and
other general purpose financial reports published by the entity
—such as its related financial statements (see paragraphs
B39–B44).

22 An entity shall identify the financial statements to which the sustainability-
related financial disclosures relate.

## Page 9

23 Data and assumptions used in preparing the sustainability-related financial disclosures shall be consistent—to the extent possible considering the requirements of IFRS Accounting Standards or other applicable GAAP—with the corresponding data and assumptions used in preparing the related financial statements (see paragraph B42).

24 When currency is specified as the unit of measure in the sustainability-related financial disclosures, the entity shall use the presentation currency of its related financial statements.

Core content

25 Unless another IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard permits or requires otherwise in specified circumstances, an entity shall provide disclosures about:

(a) governance—the governance processes, controls and procedures the entity uses to monitor and manage sustainability-related risks and opportunities (see paragraphs 26–27);

(b) strategy—the approach the entity uses to manage sustainability-related risks and opportunities (see paragraphs 28–42);

(c) risk management—the processes the entity uses to identify, assess, prioritise and monitor sustainability-related risks and opportunities (see paragraphs 43–44); and

(d) metrics and targets—the entity's performance in relation to sustainability-related risks and opportunities, including progress towards any targets the entity has set or is required to meet by law or regulation (see paragraphs 45–53).

Governance

26 The objective of sustainability-related financial disclosures on governance is to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand the governance processes, controls and procedures an entity uses to monitor, manage and oversee sustainability-related risks and opportunities.

27 To achieve this objective, an entity shall disclose information about:

(a) the governance body(s) (which can include a board, committee or equivalent body charged with governance) or individual(s) responsible for oversight of sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Specifically, the entity shall identify that body(s) or individual(s) and disclose information about:

(i) how responsibilities for sustainability-related risks and opportunities are reflected in the terms of reference, mandates, role descriptions and other related policies applicable to that body(s) or individual(s);

## Page 10

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-
RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

(ii) how the body(s) or individual(s) determines whether
appropriate skills and competencies are available or will be
developed to oversee strategies designed to respond to
sustainability-related risks and opportunities;

(iii) how and how often the body(s) or individual(s) is informed
about sustainability-related risks and opportunities;

(iv) how the body(s) or individual(s) takes into account
sustainability-related risks and opportunities when overseeing
the entity's strategy, its decisions on major transactions and its
risk management processes and related policies, including
whether the body(s) or individual(s) has considered trade-offs
associated with those risks and opportunities; and

(v) how the body(s) or individual(s) oversees the setting of targets
related to sustainability-related risks and opportunities, and
monitors progress towards those targets (see paragraph 51),
including whether and how related performance metrics are
included in remuneration policies.

(b) management's role in the governance processes, controls and
procedures used to monitor, manage and oversee sustainability-related
risks and opportunities, including information about:

(i) whether the role is delegated to a specific management-level
position or management-level committee and how oversight is
exercised over that position or committee; and

(ii) whether management uses controls and procedures to support
the oversight of sustainability-related risks and opportunities
and, if so, how these controls and procedures are integrated
with other internal functions.

Strategy

28 The objective of sustainability-related financial disclosures on strategy is to
enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand an entity's
strategy for managing sustainability-related risks and opportunities.

29 Specifically, an entity shall disclose information to enable users of general
purpose financial reports to understand:

(a) the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably
be expected to affect the entity's prospects (see paragraphs 30–31);

(b) the current and anticipated effects of those sustainability-related risks
and opportunities on the entity's business model and value chain (see
paragraph 32);

(c) the effects of those sustainability-related risks and opportunities on
the entity's strategy and decision-making (see paragraph 33);

## Page 11

(d) the effects of those sustainability-related risks and opportunities on the entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows for the reporting period, and their anticipated effects on the entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows over the short, medium and long term, taking into consideration how those sustainability-related risks and opportunities have been factored into the entity's financial planning (see paragraphs 34–40); and

(e) the resilience of the entity's strategy and its business model to those sustainability-related risks (see paragraphs 41–42).

Sustainability-related risks and opportunities

30 An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose financial reports to understand the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects. Specifically, the entity shall:

(a) describe sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects;

(b) specify the time horizons—short, medium or long term—over which the effects of each of those sustainability-related risks and opportunities could reasonably be expected to occur; and

(c) explain how the entity defines 'short term', 'medium term' and 'long term' and how these definitions are linked to the planning horizons used by the entity for strategic decision-making.

31 Short-, medium- and long- term time horizons can vary between entities and depend on many factors, including industry-specific characteristics, such as cash flow, investment and business cycles, the planning horizons typically used in an entity's industry for strategic decision-making and capital allocation plans, and the time horizons over which users of general purpose financial reports conduct their assessments of entities in that industry.

Business model and value chain

32 An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose financial reports to understand the current and anticipated effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities on the entity's business model and value chain. Specifically, the entity shall disclose:

(a) a description of the current and anticipated effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities on the entity's business model and value chain; and

(b) a description of where in the entity's business model and value chain sustainability-related risks and opportunities are concentrated (for example, geographical areas, facilities and types of assets).

## Page 12

# IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

## Strategy and decision-making

33 An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose financial reports to understand the effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities on its strategy and decision-making. Specifically, the entity shall disclose information about:

(a) how the entity has responded to, and plans to respond to, sustainability-related risks and opportunities in its strategy and decision-making;

(b) the progress against plans the entity has disclosed in previous reporting periods, including quantitative and qualitative information; and

(c) trade-offs between sustainability-related risks and opportunities that the entity considered (for example, in making a decision on the location of new operations, an entity might have considered the environmental impacts of those operations and the employment opportunities they would create in a community).

## Financial position, financial performance and cash flows

34 An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose financial reports to understand:

(a) the effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities on the entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows for the reporting period (current financial effects); and

(b) the anticipated effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities on the entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows over the short, medium and long term, taking into consideration how sustainability-related risks and opportunities are included in the entity's financial planning (anticipated financial effects).

35 Specifically, an entity shall disclose quantitative and qualitative information about:

(a) how sustainability-related risks and opportunities have affected its financial position, financial performance and cash flows for the reporting period;

(b) the sustainability-related risks and opportunities identified in paragraph 35(a) for which there is a significant risk of a material adjustment within the next annual reporting period to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the related financial statements;

(c) how the entity expects its financial position to change over the short, medium and long term, given its strategy to manage sustainability-related risks and opportunities, taking into consideration:

## Page 13

(i) its investment and disposal plans (for example, plans for capital expenditure, major acquisitions and divestments, joint ventures, business transformation, innovation, new business areas, and asset retirements), including plans the entity is not contractually committed to; and

(ii) its planned sources of funding to implement its strategy; and

(d) how the entity expects its financial performance and cash flows to change over the short, medium and long term, given its strategy to manage sustainability-related risks and opportunities.

36 In providing quantitative information, an entity may disclose a single amount or a range.

37 In preparing disclosures about the anticipated financial effects of a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, an entity shall:

(a) use all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort (see paragraphs B8–B10); and

(b) use an approach that is commensurate with the skills, capabilities and resources that are available to the entity for preparing those disclosures.

38 An entity need not provide quantitative information about the current or anticipated financial effects of a sustainability-related risk or opportunity if the entity determines that:

(a) those effects are not separately identifiable; or

(b) the level of measurement uncertainty involved in estimating those effects is so high that the resulting quantitative information would not be useful (see paragraphs 77–82).

39 In addition, an entity need not provide quantitative information about the anticipated financial effects of a sustainability-related risk or opportunity if the entity does not have the skills, capabilities or resources to provide that quantitative information.

40 If an entity determines that it need not provide quantitative information about the current or anticipated financial effects of a sustainability-related risk or opportunity applying the criteria set out in paragraphs 38–39, the entity shall:

(a) explain why it has not provided quantitative information;

(b) provide qualitative information about those financial effects, including identifying line items, totals and subtotals within the related financial statements that are likely to be affected, or have been affected, by that sustainability-related risk or opportunity; and

## Page 14

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-
RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

(c)    provide quantitative information about the combined financial effects
       of that sustainability-related risk or opportunity with other
       sustainability-related risks or opportunities and other factors unless
       the entity determines that quantitative information about the
       combined financial effects would not be useful.

Resilience

41    An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose
      financial reports to understand its capacity to adjust to the uncertainties
      arising from sustainability-related risks. An entity shall disclose a qualitative
      and, if applicable, quantitative assessment of the resilience of its strategy and
      business model in relation to its sustainability-related risks, including
      information about how the assessment was carried out and its time horizon.
      When providing quantitative information, an entity may disclose a single
      amount or a range.

42    Other IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards may specify the type of
      information an entity is required to disclose about its resilience to specific
      sustainability-related risks and how to prepare those disclosures, including
      whether a scenario analysis is required.

Risk management

43    The objective of sustainability-related financial disclosures on risk
      management is to enable users of general purpose financial reports:

      (a)    to understand an entity's processes to identify, assess, prioritise and
             monitor sustainability-related risks and opportunities, including
             whether and how those processes are integrated into and inform
             the entity's overall risk management process; and

      (b)    to assess the entity's overall risk profile and its overall risk
             management process.

44    To achieve this objective, an entity shall disclose information about:

      (a)    the processes and related policies the entity uses to identify, assess,
             prioritise and monitor sustainability-related risks, including
             information about:

             (i)     the inputs and parameters the entity uses (for example,
                     information about data sources and the scope of operations
                     covered in the processes);

             (ii)    whether and how the entity uses scenario analysis to inform its
                     identification of sustainability-related risks;

             (iii)   how the entity assesses the nature, likelihood and magnitude of
                     the effects of those risks (for example, whether the entity
                     considers qualitative factors, quantitative thresholds or other
                     criteria);

             (iv)    whether and how the entity prioritises sustainability-related
                     risks relative to other types of risk;

## Page 15

(v) how the entity monitors sustainability-related risks; and

(vi) whether and how the entity has changed the processes it uses compared with the previous reporting period;

(b) the processes the entity uses to identify, assess, prioritise and monitor sustainability-related opportunities; and

(c) the extent to which, and how, the processes for identifying, assessing, prioritising and monitoring sustainability-related risks and opportunities are integrated into and inform the entity's overall risk management process.

## Metrics and targets

45 The objective of sustainability-related financial disclosures on metrics and targets is to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand an entity's performance in relation to its sustainability-related risks and opportunities, including progress towards any targets the entity has set, and any targets it is required to meet by law or regulation.

46 An entity shall disclose, for each sustainability-related risk and opportunity that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects:

(a) metrics required by an applicable IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard; and

(b) metrics the entity uses to measure and monitor:

    (i) that sustainability-related risk or opportunity; and

    (ii) its performance in relation to that sustainability-related risk or opportunity, including progress towards any targets the entity has set, and any targets it is required to meet by law or regulation.

47 In the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, an entity shall apply paragraphs 57–58 to identify applicable metrics.

48 Metrics disclosed by an entity applying paragraphs 45–46 shall include metrics associated with particular business models, activities or other common features that characterise participation in an industry.

49 If an entity discloses a metric taken from a source other than IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, the entity shall identify the source and the metric taken.

50 If a metric has been developed by an entity, the entity shall disclose information about:

(a) how the metric is defined, including whether it is derived by adjusting a metric taken from a source other than IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards and, if so, which source and how the metric disclosed by the entity differs from the metric specified in that source;

## Page 16

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-
RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

(b) whether the metric is an absolute measure, a measure expressed in
relation to another metric or a qualitative measure (such as a red,
amber, green—or RAG—status);

(c) whether the metric is validated by a third party and, if so, which party;
and

(d) the method used to calculate the metric and the inputs to the
calculation, including the limitations of the method used and the
significant assumptions made.

51 An entity shall disclose information about the targets it has set to monitor
progress towards achieving its strategic goals, and any targets it is required to
meet by law or regulation. For each target, the entity shall disclose:

(a) the metric used to set the target and to monitor progress towards
reaching the target;

(b) the specific quantitative or qualitative target the entity has set or is
required to meet;

(c) the period over which the target applies;

(d) the base period from which progress is measured;

(e) any milestones and interim targets;

(f) performance against each target and an analysis of trends or changes
in the entity's performance; and

(g) any revisions to the target and an explanation for those revisions.

52 The definition and calculation of metrics, including metrics used to set the
entity's targets and monitor progress towards reaching them, shall be
consistent over time. If a metric is redefined or replaced, an entity shall apply
paragraph B52.

53 An entity shall label and define metrics and targets using meaningful, clear
and precise names and descriptions.

General requirements

Sources of guidance

Identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities

54 In identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could
reasonably be expected to affect an entity's prospects, an entity shall apply
IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.

55 In addition to IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards:

(a) an entity shall refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure
topics in the SASB Standards. An entity might conclude that the
disclosure topics in the SASB Standards are not applicable in the
entity's circumstances.

## Page 17

(b) an entity may refer to and consider the applicability of:

    (i)    the CDSB Framework Application Guidance for Water-related 
           Disclosures and the CDSB Framework Application Guidance for 
           Biodiversity-related Disclosures (collectively referred to as 
           'CDSB Framework Application Guidance');

    (ii)   the most recent pronouncements of other standard-setting 
           bodies whose requirements are designed to meet the 
           information needs of users of general purpose financial reports; 
           and

    (iii)  the sustainability-related risks and opportunities identified by 
           entities that operate in the same industry(s) or geographical 
           region(s).

Identifying applicable disclosure requirements

56 In identifying applicable disclosure requirements about a sustainability-
related risk or opportunity that could reasonably be expected to affect an 
entity's prospects, an entity shall apply the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure 
Standard that specifically applies to that sustainability-related risk or 
opportunity.

57 In the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically 
applies to a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, an entity shall apply 
judgement to identify information that:

(a) is relevant to the decision-making of users of general purpose financial 
    reports; and

(b) faithfully represents that sustainability-related risk or opportunity.

58 In making the judgement described in paragraph 57:

(a) an entity shall refer to and consider the applicability of the metrics 
    associated with the disclosure topics included in the SASB Standards. 
    An entity might conclude that the metrics specified in the SASB 
    Standards are not applicable in the entity's circumstances.

(b) an entity may—to the extent that these sources do not conflict with 
    IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards—refer to and consider the 
    applicability of:

    (i)    the CDSB Framework Application Guidance;

    (ii)   the most recent pronouncements of other standard-setting 
           bodies whose requirements are designed to meet the 
           information needs of users of general purpose financial reports; 
           and

    (iii)  the information, including metrics, disclosed by entities that 
           operate in the same industry(s) or geographical region(s).

## Page 18

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-
RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

(c)    an entity may—to the extent that these sources assist the entity in
       meeting the objective of this Standard (see paragraphs 1–4) and do not
       conflict with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards—refer to and
       consider the applicability of the sources specified in Appendix C.

Disclosure of information about sources of guidance

59    An entity shall identify:

      (a)    the specific standards, pronouncements, industry practice and other
             sources of guidance that the entity has applied in preparing its
             sustainability-related financial disclosures, including, if applicable,
             identifying the disclosure topics in the SASB Standards; and

      (b)    the industry(s) specified in the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure
             Standards, the SASB Standards or other sources of guidance relating to
             a particular industry(s) that the entity has applied in preparing its
             sustainability-related financial disclosures, including in identifying
             applicable metrics.

Location of disclosures

60    An entity is required to provide disclosures required by IFRS Sustainability
      Disclosure Standards as part of its general purpose financial reports.

61    Subject to any regulation or other requirements that apply to an entity, there
      are various possible locations in its general purpose financial reports in which
      to disclose sustainability-related financial information. Sustainability-related
      financial disclosures could be included in an entity's management
      commentary or a similar report when it forms part of an entity's general
      purpose financial reports. Management commentary or a similar report is a
      required report in many jurisdictions. It might be known by or included in
      reports with various names, such as 'management report', 'management's
      discussion and analysis', 'operating and financial review', 'integrated report' or
      'strategic report'.

62    An entity may disclose information required by an IFRS Sustainability
      Disclosure Standard in the same location as information disclosed to meet
      other requirements, such as information required by regulators. The entity
      shall ensure that the sustainability-related financial disclosures are clearly
      identifiable and not obscured by that additional information (see
      paragraph B27).

63    Information required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard may be
      included in sustainability-related financial disclosures by cross-reference to
      another report published by the entity. If an entity includes information by
      cross-reference, the entity shall apply the requirements in paragraphs
      B45–B47.

## Page 19

# Timing of reporting

64 An entity shall report its sustainability-related financial disclosures at the same time as its related financial statements. The entity's sustainability-related financial disclosures shall cover the same reporting period as the related financial statements.

65 Normally, an entity prepares sustainability-related financial disclosures for a 12-month period. However, for practical reasons, some entities prefer to report, for example, for a 52-week period. This Standard does not preclude that practice.

66 When an entity changes the end of its reporting period and provides sustainability-related financial disclosures for a period longer or shorter than 12 months, it shall disclose:

(a) the period covered by the sustainability-related financial disclosures;

(b) the reason for using a longer or shorter period; and

(c) the fact that the amounts disclosed in the sustainability-related financial disclosures are not entirely comparable.

67 If, after the end of the reporting period but before the date on which the sustainability-related financial disclosures are authorised for issue, an entity receives information about conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall update disclosures that relate to those conditions in the light of the new information.

68 An entity shall disclose information about transactions, other events and conditions that occur after the end of the reporting period, but before the date on which the sustainability-related financial disclosures are authorised for issue, if non-disclosure of that information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that primary users of general purpose financial reports make on the basis of those reports.

69 This Standard does not mandate which entities would be required to provide interim sustainability-related financial disclosures, how frequently, or how soon after the end of an interim period. However, governments, securities regulators, stock exchanges and accountancy bodies may require entities whose debt or equity securities are publicly traded to publish interim general purpose financial reports. If an entity is required or elects to publish interim sustainability-related financial disclosures in accordance with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, the entity shall apply paragraph B48.

# Comparative information

70 Unless another IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard permits or requires otherwise, an entity shall disclose comparative information in respect of the preceding period for all amounts disclosed in the reporting period. If such information would be useful for an understanding of the sustainability-related financial disclosures for the reporting period, the entity shall also disclose comparative information for narrative and descriptive information.

## Page 20

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-
RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

descriptive sustainability-related financial information (see paragraphs
B49–B59).

71 Amounts reported in sustainability-related financial disclosures might relate,
for example, to metrics and targets or to current and anticipated financial
effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities.

Statement of compliance

72 An entity whose sustainability-related financial disclosures comply with all
the requirements of IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards shall make an
explicit and unreserved statement of compliance. An entity shall not
describe sustainability-related financial disclosures as complying with IFRS
Sustainability Disclosure Standards unless they comply with all the
requirements of IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.

73 This Standard relieves an entity from disclosing information otherwise
required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard if law or regulation
prohibits the entity from disclosing that information (see paragraph B33). This
Standard also relieves an entity from disclosing information about a
sustainability-related opportunity otherwise required by an IFRS Sustainability
Disclosure Standard if that information is commercially sensitive as described
in this Standard (see paragraphs B34–B37). An entity using these exemptions is
not prevented from asserting compliance with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure
Standards.

Judgements, uncertainties and errors

Judgements

74 An entity shall disclose information to enable users of general purpose
financial reports to understand the judgements, apart from those involving
estimations of amounts (see paragraph 77), that the entity has made in the
process of preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures and that
have the most significant effect on the information included in those
disclosures.

75 In the process of preparing sustainability-related financial disclosures, an
entity makes various judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that
can significantly affect the information reported in the entity's sustainability-
related financial disclosures. For example, an entity makes judgements in:

(a) identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could be
reasonably expected to affect the entity's prospects;

(b) determining which sources of guidance to apply in accordance with
paragraphs 54–58;

(c) identifying material information to include in the sustainability-
related financial disclosures; and

## Page 21

(d) assessing whether an event or change in circumstances is significant and requires reassessment of the scope of all affected sustainability-related risks and opportunities throughout the entity's value chain (see paragraph B11).

76 Other IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards may require disclosure of some of the information that an entity would otherwise be required to disclose in accordance with paragraph 74.

Measurement uncertainty

77 An entity shall disclose information to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand the most significant uncertainties affecting the amounts reported in its sustainability-related financial disclosures.

78 An entity shall:

(a) identify the amounts that it has disclosed that are subject to a high level of measurement uncertainty; and

(b) in relation to each amount identified in paragraph 78(a), disclose information about:

(i) the sources of measurement uncertainty—for example, the dependence of the amount on the outcome of a future event, on a measurement technique or on the availability and quality of data from the entity's value chain; and

(ii) the assumptions, approximations and judgements the entity has made in measuring the amount.

79 When amounts reported in sustainability-related financial disclosures cannot be measured directly and can only be estimated, measurement uncertainty arises. In some cases, an estimate involves assumptions about possible future events with uncertain outcomes. The use of reasonable estimates is an essential part of preparing sustainability-related financial disclosures and does not undermine the usefulness of the information if the estimates are accurately described and explained. Even a high level of measurement uncertainty would not necessarily prevent such an estimate from providing useful information.

80 The requirement in paragraph 77 for an entity to disclose information about the uncertainties affecting the amounts reported in sustainability-related financial disclosures relates to the estimates that require the entity's most difficult, subjective or complex judgements. As the number of variables and assumptions increases, those judgements become more subjective and complex, and the uncertainty affecting the amounts reported in the sustainability-related financial disclosures increases accordingly.

81 The type and extent of the information an entity might need to disclose vary according to the nature of the amount reported in the sustainability-related financial disclosures—the sources of and the factors contributing to the uncertainty and other circumstances. Examples of the type of information an entity might need to disclose are:

## Page 22

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-
RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

(a) the nature of the assumption or other source of measurement
uncertainty;

(b) the sensitivity of the disclosed amount to the methods, assumptions
and estimates underlying its calculation, including the reasons for the
sensitivity;

(c) the expected resolution of an uncertainty and the range of reasonably
possible outcomes for the disclosed amount; and

(d) an explanation of changes made to past assumptions concerning the
disclosed amount, if the uncertainty remains unresolved.

82 Other IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards may require disclosure of some
of the information that an entity would otherwise be required to disclose in
accordance with paragraphs 77–78.

Errors

83 An entity shall correct material prior period errors by restating the
comparative amounts for the prior period(s) disclosed unless it is
impracticable to do so.

84 Prior period errors are omissions from and misstatements in the entity's
sustainability-related financial disclosures for one or more prior periods. Such
errors arise from a failure to use, or the misuse of, reliable information that:

(a) was available when the sustainability-related financial disclosures for
that period(s) were authorised for issue; and

(b) could reasonably be expected to have been obtained and considered in
the preparation of those disclosures.

85 Corrections of errors are distinguished from changes in estimates. Estimates
are approximations that an entity might need to revise as additional
information becomes known.

86 If an entity identifies a material error in its prior period sustainability-related
financial disclosures, it shall apply paragraphs B55–B59.

# Appendix B
# Application guidance

This appendix is an integral part of IFRS S1 and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.

## Sustainability-related risks and opportunities (paragraphs 11–12)

B1 | This Standard requires an entity to disclose information about all sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital over the short, medium or long term (referred to as 'sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects') (see paragraph 3).

B2 | An entity's sustainability-related risks and opportunities arise out of the interactions between the entity and its stakeholders, society, the economy and the natural environment throughout the entity's value chain. These interactions—which can be direct and indirect—result from operating an entity's business model in pursuit of the entity's strategic purposes and from the external environment in which the entity operates. These interactions take place within an interdependent system in which an entity both depends on resources and relationships throughout its value chain to generate cash flows and affects those resources and relationships through its activities and outputs—contributing to the preservation, regeneration and development of those resources and relationships or to their degradation and depletion. These dependencies and impacts might give rise to sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity's cash flows, its access to finance and cost of capital over the short, medium and long term.

B3 | For example, if an entity's business model depends on a natural resource— such as water—the entity could both affect and be affected by the quality, availability and affordability of that resource. Specifically, degradation or depletion of that resource—including resulting from the entity's own activities and from other factors—could create a risk of disruption to the entity's operations and affect the entity's business model or strategy and could ultimately negatively affect the entity's financial performance and financial position. In contrast, regeneration and preservation of that resource— including resulting from the entity's own activities and from other factors— could positively affect the entity. Similarly, if an entity operates in a highly competitive market and requires a highly specialised workforce to achieve its strategic purposes, the entity's future success will likely depend on the entity's ability to attract and retain that resource. At the same time, that ability will depend, in part, on the entity's employment practices—such as whether the entity invests in employee training and wellbeing—and the levels of employee satisfaction, engagement and retention. These examples illustrate the close relationship between the value the entity creates, preserves or erodes for others and the entity's own ability to succeed and achieve its goals.

## Page 26

# IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

B4 Resources and relationships that an entity depends on and affects by its activities and outputs can take various forms, such as natural, manufactured, intellectual, human, social or financial. They can be internal—such as the entity's workforce, its know-how or its organisational processes—or they can be external—such as materials and services the entity needs to access or the relationships it has with suppliers, distributors and customers. Furthermore, resources and relationships include, but are not limited to, the resources and relationships recognised as assets in the entity's financial statements.

B5 An entity's dependencies and impacts are not limited to resources the entity engages with directly, and to the entity's direct relationships. Those dependencies and impacts also relate to resources and relationships throughout the entity's value chain. For example, they can relate to the entity's supply and distribution channels; the effects of the consumption and disposal of the entity's products; and the entity's sources of finance and its investments, including investments in associates and joint ventures. If the entity's business partners throughout its value chain face sustainability-related risks and opportunities, the entity could be exposed to related consequences of its own.

## Identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities

B6 An entity shall use all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort (see paragraphs B8–B10):

(a) to identify the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects; and

(b) to determine the scope of its value chain, including its breadth and composition, in relation to each of those sustainability-related risks and opportunities.

B7 In identifying the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect its prospects, an entity shall apply the requirements on sources of guidance in paragraphs 54–55.

## Reasonable and supportable information

B8 Reasonable and supportable information used by an entity in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures shall cover factors that are specific to the entity as well as general conditions in the external environment. In some cases—such as in identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity's prospects—reasonable and supportable information includes information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions. Other IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards may specify what is reasonable and supportable information in specific cases.

## Page 27

B9 An entity may use various sources of data that may be both internal and
external. Possible data sources include the entity's risk management
processes; industry and peer group experience; and external ratings, reports
and statistics. Information that is used by the entity in preparing its financial
statements, operating its business model, setting its strategy and managing its
risks and opportunities is considered to be available to the entity without
undue cost or effort.

B10 An entity need not undertake an exhaustive search for information to identify
sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be
expected to affect the entity's prospects. The assessment of what constitutes
undue cost or effort depends on the entity's specific circumstances and
requires a balanced consideration of the costs and efforts for the entity and
the benefits of the resulting information for primary users. That assessment
can change over time as circumstances change.

# Reassessment of the scope of sustainability-related risks and opportunities throughout the value chain

B11 On the occurrence of a significant event or significant change in
circumstances, an entity shall reassess the scope of all affected sustainability-
related risks and opportunities throughout its value chain. A significant event
or significant change in circumstances can occur without the entity being
involved in that event or change in circumstances or as a result of a change in
what the entity assesses to be important to users of general purpose financial
reports. For example, such significant events or significant changes in
circumstances might include:

(a) a significant change in the entity's value chain (for example, a supplier
in the entity's value chain makes a change that significantly alters the
supplier's greenhouse gas emissions);

(b) a significant change in the entity's business model, activities or
corporate structure (for example, a merger or acquisition that expands
the entity's value chain); and

(c) a significant change in an entity's exposure to sustainability-related
risks and opportunities (for example, a supplier in the entity's value
chain is affected by the introduction of a new regulation that the
entity had not anticipated).

B12 An entity is permitted, but not required, to reassess the scope of any
sustainability-related risk or opportunity throughout its value chain more
frequently than required by paragraph B11.

# Materiality (paragraphs 17–19)

B13 Paragraph 17 requires an entity to disclose material information about the
sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be
expected to affect the entity's prospects. Materiality of information is judged
in relation to whether omitting, misstating or obscuring that information
could reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of

## Page 28

# IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

general purpose financial reports, which provide information about a specific reporting entity.

B14 The decisions of primary users relate to providing resources to the entity and involve decisions about:

(a) buying, selling or holding equity and debt instruments;

(b) providing or selling loans and other forms of credit; or

(c) exercising rights to vote on, or otherwise influence, the entity's management's actions that affect the use of the entity's economic resources.

B15 The decisions described in paragraph B14 depend on primary users' expectations about returns, for example, dividends, principal and interest payments or market price increases. Those expectations depend on primary users' assessment of the amount, timing and uncertainty of future net cash inflows to the entity and on their assessment of stewardship of the entity's economic resources by the entity's management and its governing body(s) or individual(s).

B16 Assessing whether information could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions made by primary users requires consideration of the characteristics of those users and of the entity's own circumstances.

B17 Sustainability-related financial disclosures are prepared for primary users who have reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and who review and analyse information diligently. At times, even well-informed and diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand sustainability-related financial information.

B18 Individual primary users may have different, and sometimes even conflicting, information needs and desires. Information needs of primary users may also evolve over time. Sustainability-related financial disclosures are intended to meet common information needs of primary users.

## Identifying material information

B19 Materiality judgements are specific to an entity. Consequently, this Standard does not specify any thresholds for materiality or predetermine what would be material in a particular situation.

B20 To identify material information about a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, an entity shall apply, as the starting point, the requirements of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to that sustainability-related risk or opportunity. In the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, the entity shall apply the requirements on sources of guidance specified in paragraphs 57–58. Those sources specify information, including metrics, that may be relevant to a particular sustainability-related risk or opportunity, to a particular industry or in specified circumstances.

## Page 29

B21 An entity shall assess whether the information identified in applying paragraph B20, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of the entity's sustainability-related financial disclosures taken as a whole. In assessing whether information is material, an entity shall consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. For example, an entity might consider the magnitude and the nature of the effect of a sustainability-related risk or opportunity on the entity.

B22 In some cases, IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards require the disclosure of information about possible future events with uncertain outcomes. In judging whether information about such possible future events is material, an entity shall consider:

(a) the potential effects of the events on the amount, timing and uncertainty of the entity's future cash flows over the short, medium and long term (referred to as 'the possible outcome'); and

(b) the range of possible outcomes and the likelihood of the possible outcomes within that range.

B23 When considering possible outcomes, an entity shall consider all pertinent facts and circumstances. Information about a possible future event is more likely to be judged as being material if the potential effects are significant and the event is likely to occur. However, an entity shall also consider whether information about low-probability and high-impact outcomes might be material either individually or in combination with information about other low-probability and high-impact outcomes. For example, an entity might be exposed to several sustainability-related risks, each of which could cause the same type of disruption—such as disruption to the entity's supply chain. Information about an individual source of risk might not be material if disruption from that source is highly unlikely to occur. However, information about the aggregate risk—the risk of supply chain disruption from all sources —might be material.

B24 If a possible future event is expected to affect an entity's cash flows, but only many years in the future, information about that event is usually less likely to be judged material than information about a possible future event with similar effects that are expected to occur sooner. However, in some circumstances, an item of information could reasonably be expected to influence primary users' decisions regardless of the magnitude of the potential effects of the future event or the timing of that event. For example, this might happen if information about a particular sustainability-related risk or opportunity is highly scrutinised by primary users of an entity's general purpose financial reports.

B25 An entity need not disclose information otherwise required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard if the information is not material. This is the case even if the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard contains a list of specific requirements or describes them as minimum requirements.

## Page 30

# IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

B26    An entity shall disclose additional information when compliance with the specifically applicable requirements in an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard is insufficient to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand the effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities on the entity's cash flows, its access to finance and cost of capital over the short, medium and long term.

B27    An entity shall identify its sustainability-related financial disclosures clearly and distinguish them from other information provided by the entity (see paragraph 62). An entity shall not obscure material information. Information is obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar effect for primary users to omitting or misstating that information. Examples of circumstances that might result in material information being obscured include:

(a)    material information is not clearly distinguished from additional information that is not material;

(b)    material information is disclosed in the sustainability-related financial disclosures, but the language used is vague or unclear;

(c)    material information about a sustainability-related risk or opportunity is scattered throughout the sustainability-related financial disclosures;

(d)    items of information that are dissimilar are inappropriately aggregated;

(e)    items of information that are similar are inappropriately disaggregated; and

(f)    the understandability of the sustainability-related financial disclosures is reduced as a result of material information being hidden by immaterial information to the extent that a primary user is unable to determine what information is material.

B28    An entity shall reassess its materiality judgements at each reporting date to take account of changed circumstances and assumptions. Because of changes in the entity's individual circumstances, or in the external environment, some types of information included in an entity's sustainability-related financial disclosures for prior periods might no longer be material. Conversely, some types of information not previously disclosed might become material.

## Aggregation and disaggregation

B29    When an entity applies IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, it shall consider all facts and circumstances and decide how to aggregate and disaggregate information in its sustainability-related financial disclosures. The entity shall not reduce the understandability of its sustainability-related financial disclosures by obscuring material information with immaterial information or by aggregating material items of information that are dissimilar to each other.

## Page 31

B30 An entity shall not aggregate information if doing so would obscure information that is material. Information shall be aggregated if items of information have shared characteristics and shall not be aggregated if they do not have shared characteristics. The entity might need to disaggregate information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities, for example, by geographical location or in consideration of the geopolitical environment. For example, to ensure that material information is not obscured, an entity might need to disaggregate information about its use of water to distinguish between water drawn from abundant sources and water drawn from water-stressed areas.

# Interaction with law or regulation

B31 Law or regulation might specify requirements for an entity to disclose sustainability-related information in its general purpose financial reports. In such circumstances, the entity is permitted to include in its sustainability-related financial disclosures information to meet legal or regulatory requirements, even if that information is not material. However, such information shall not obscure material information.

B32 An entity shall disclose material sustainability-related financial information, even if law or regulation permits the entity not to disclose such information.

B33 An entity need not disclose information otherwise required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard if law or regulation prohibits the entity from disclosing that information. If an entity omits material information for that reason, it shall identify the type of information not disclosed and explain the source of the restriction.

# Commercially sensitive information

B34 If an entity determines that information about a sustainability-related opportunity is commercially sensitive in the limited circumstances described in paragraph B35, the entity is permitted to omit that information from its sustainability-related financial disclosures. Such an omission is permitted even if information is otherwise required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard and the information is material.

B35 An entity qualifies for the exemption specified in paragraph B34 if, and only if:

(a) information about the sustainability-related opportunity is not already publicly available;

(b) disclosure of that information could reasonably be expected to prejudice seriously the economic benefits the entity would otherwise be able to realise in pursuing the opportunity; and

(c) the entity has determined that it is impossible to disclose that information in a manner—for example, at an aggregated level—that would enable the entity to meet the objectives of the disclosure requirements without prejudicing seriously the economic benefits the entity would otherwise be able to realise in pursuing the opportunity.

## Page 32

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-
RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

B36    If an entity elects to use the exemption specified in paragraph B34, the entity
       shall, for each item of information omitted:

       (a)    disclose the fact that it has used the exemption; and

       (b)    reassess, at each reporting date, whether the information qualifies for
              the exemption.

B37    An entity is prohibited from using the exemption specified in paragraph B34
       in relation to a sustainability-related risk or as a basis for broad non-disclosure
       of sustainability-related financial information.

Reporting entity (paragraph 20)

B38    Paragraph 20 requires that sustainability-related financial disclosures shall be
       for the same reporting entity as the related financial statements. For example,
       consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS
       Accounting Standards provide information about the parent and its
       subsidiaries as a single reporting entity. Consequently, that entity's
       sustainability-related financial disclosures shall enable users of general
       purpose financial reports to understand the effects of the sustainability-
       related risks and opportunities on the cash flows, access to finance and cost of
       capital over the short, medium and long term for the parent and its
       subsidiaries.

Connected information (paragraphs 21–24)

B39    Paragraph 21 requires an entity to provide information in a manner that
       enables users of general purpose financial reports to understand connections
       both between the items to which the information relates and between
       disclosures provided by the entity in its general purpose financial reports.

B40    Connected information provides insight into connections between the items to
       which the information relates. For example:

       (a)    if an entity pursued a particular sustainability-related opportunity and
              that resulted in an increase in the entity's revenue, connected
              information will depict that relationship between the entity's strategy
              and its financial performance;

       (b)    if an entity identified a trade-off between two sustainability-related
              risks it is exposed to and took action on the basis of its assessment of
              that trade-off, connected information will depict the relationship
              between those risks and the entity's strategy; and

       (c)    if an entity committed to a particular sustainability-related target, but
              that commitment has not yet affected the entity's financial position or
              financial performance because the applicable recognition criteria have
              not been met, connected information will depict that relationship.

B41    Connected information includes:

       (a)    connections between various types of information about a particular
              sustainability-related risk or opportunity, such as:

## Page 33

(i) between disclosures on governance, strategy and risk
management; and

(ii) between narrative information and quantitative information
(including related metrics and targets and information in the
related financial statements).

(b) connections between disclosures about various sustainability-related
risks and opportunities. For example, if an entity integrates its
oversight of sustainability-related risks and opportunities, the entity
shall integrate the disclosures on governance instead of providing
separate disclosures on governance for each sustainability-related risk
and opportunity.

B42 Drawing connections between disclosures involves, but is not limited to,
providing necessary explanations and cross-references and using consistent
data, assumptions, and units of measure. In providing connected information,
an entity shall:

(a) explain connections between disclosures in a clear and concise
manner;

(b) avoid unnecessary duplication if IFRS Sustainability Disclosure
Standards require the disclosure of common items of information; and

(c) disclose information about significant differences between the data
and assumptions used in preparing the entity's sustainability-related
financial disclosures and the data and assumptions used in preparing
the related financial statements.

B43 For example, in providing connected information an entity might need to
explain the effect or likely effect of its strategy on its financial statements and
financial planning, or explain how that strategy relates to the metrics the
entity uses to measure progress against targets. Another entity might need to
explain how its use of natural resources or changes within its supply chain
could amplify or, in contrast, reduce its sustainability-related risks and
opportunities. The entity might need to link the information about its use of
natural resources or changes within its supply chain to information about
current or anticipated financial effects on the entity's production costs, its
strategic response to mitigate those risks and its related investment in new
assets. The entity might need to link narrative information to the related
metrics and targets and to information in the related financial statements.

B44 Other examples of connected information include:

(a) an explanation of the combined effects of the entity's sustainability-
related risks and opportunities and its strategy on its financial
position, financial performance and cash flows over the short, medium
and long term. For example, an entity might face decreasing demand
for its products because of consumer preferences for lower-carbon
alternatives. The entity might need to explain how its strategic
response, such as closing a major factory, could affect its workforce

## Page 34

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-
RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

and local communities, and the effect of such a closure on the useful
lives of its assets and on impairment assessments.

(b) a description of the alternatives that an entity evaluated in setting its
strategy in response to its sustainability-related risks and
opportunities, including a description of the trade-offs between those
risks and opportunities that the entity considered (see paragraph 33(c)).
For example, an entity might need to explain the potential effects of its
decision to restructure its operations in response to a sustainability-
related risk on the future size and composition of the entity's
workforce.

Information included by cross-reference (paragraph 63)

B45 Information required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard might be
available in another report published by the entity. For example, the required
information could be disclosed in the related financial statements. Material
information can be included in an entity's sustainability-related financial
disclosures by cross-reference, provided that:

(a) the cross-referenced information is available on the same terms and at
the same time as the sustainability-related financial disclosures; and

(b) the complete set of sustainability-related financial disclosures is not
made less understandable by including information by cross-reference.

B46 Information included by cross-reference becomes part of the complete set of
sustainability-related financial disclosures and shall comply with the
requirements of IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. For example, it
needs to be relevant, representationally faithful, comparable, verifiable, timely
and understandable. The body(s) or individual(s) that authorises the general
purpose financial reports takes the same responsibility for the information
included by cross-reference as it does for the information included directly.

B47 If information required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard is
included by cross-reference:

(a) the sustainability-related financial disclosures shall clearly identify the
report within which that information is located and explain how to
access that report; and

(b) the cross-reference shall be to a precisely specified part of that report.

Interim reporting (paragraph 69)

B48 In the interest of timeliness and cost considerations, and to avoid repetition of
information previously reported, an entity may be required or choose to
provide less information at interim dates than it provides in its annual
sustainability-related financial disclosures. Interim sustainability-related
financial disclosures are intended to provide an update on the latest complete
set of annual disclosures of sustainability-related financial information. These
disclosures focus on new information, events and circumstances and do not
duplicate information previously reported. Although the information

## Page 35

provided in interim sustainability-related financial disclosures may be more
condensed than in annual sustainability-related financial disclosures, an
entity is not prohibited or discouraged from publishing a complete set of
sustainability-related financial disclosures as specified in this Standard as part
of its interim general purpose financial report.

Comparative information (paragraphs 52, 70 and 83–86)
B49    Paragraph 70 requires an entity to disclose comparative information in respect
of the preceding period for all amounts disclosed in the reporting period.

Metrics
B50    In some cases, the amount disclosed for a metric is an estimate. Except as
specified in paragraph B51, if an entity identifies new information in relation
to the estimated amount disclosed in the preceding period and the new
information provides evidence of circumstances that existed in that period,
the entity shall:

(a)    disclose a revised comparative amount that reflects that new
information;

(b)    disclose the difference between the amount disclosed in the preceding
period and the revised comparative amount; and

(c)    explain the reasons for revising the comparative amount.

B51    In applying the requirement in paragraph B50, an entity need not disclose a
revised comparative amount:

(a)    if it is impracticable to do so (see paragraph B54).

(b)    if the metric is forward-looking. Forward-looking metrics relate to
possible future transactions, events and other conditions. The entity is
permitted to revise a comparative amount for a forward-looking metric
if doing so does not involve the use of hindsight.

B52    If an entity redefines or replaces a metric in the reporting period, the entity
shall:

(a)    disclose a revised comparative amount, unless it is impracticable to do
so;

(b)    explain the changes; and

(c)    explain the reasons for those changes, including why the redefined or
replacement metric provides more useful information.

B53    If an entity introduces a new metric in the reporting period, it shall disclose a
comparative amount for that metric unless it is impracticable to do so.

B54    Sometimes, it is impracticable to revise a comparative amount to achieve
comparability with the reporting period. For example, data might not have
been collected in the preceding period in a way that allows retrospective
application of a new definition of a metric, and it might be impracticable to

## Page 36

# IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

recreate the data. If it is impracticable to revise a comparative amount for the
preceding period, an entity shall disclose that fact.

## Errors

B55 Paragraph 83 requires an entity to correct material prior period errors.

B56 Such errors include: the effects of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in
applying the definitions for metrics or targets, oversights or
misinterpretations of facts, and fraud.

B57 Potential reporting period errors discovered in that period are corrected before
the sustainability-related financial disclosures are authorised for issue.
However, material errors are sometimes not discovered until a subsequent
period.

B58 If an entity identifies a material error in its prior period(s) sustainabilityrelated financial disclosures, it shall disclose:

(a) the nature of the prior period error;

(b) the correction, to the extent practicable, for each prior period
disclosed; and

(c) if correction of the error is impracticable, the circumstances that led to
the existence of that condition and a description of how and from
when the error has been corrected.

B59 When it is impracticable to determine the effect of an error on all prior
periods presented, the entity shall restate the comparative information to
correct the error from the earliest date practicable.

# Sources of guidance

This appendix is an integral part of IFRS S1 and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.

C1    This Standard requires (see paragraph 57) that in the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, an entity shall apply judgement to identify information that:

(a)    is relevant to the decision-making of users of general purpose financial reports; and

(b)    faithfully represents that sustainability-related risk or opportunity.

C2    In making that judgement, an entity may—to the extent that these sources assist the entity in meeting the objective of this Standard (see paragraphs 1–4) and do not conflict with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards—refer to and consider the applicability of:

(a)    the Global Reporting Initiative Standards; and

(b)    the European Sustainability Reporting Standards.

C3    In applying the sources of guidance specified in paragraph C2, an entity shall not obscure material information required by IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (see paragraph B27). If an entity applies the sources of guidance specified in paragraph C2 without applying the requirements in IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, the entity shall not make an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.

## Appendix D
## Qualitative characteristics of useful sustainability-related financial information

This appendix is an integral part of IFRS S1 and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.

## Introduction

D1    The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Conceptual Framework) was issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). It describes the objective of, and the concepts that apply to, general purpose financial reports. One purpose of the Conceptual Framework is to assist the IASB to develop IFRS Accounting Standards for preparing financial statements based on consistent concepts.

D2    Sustainability-related financial disclosures are part of general purpose financial reports. The qualitative characteristics in the Conceptual Framework, therefore, apply to sustainability-related financial information. However, the nature of some of the information required to meet the objective of this Standard (see paragraphs 1–4) differs in some respects from the information provided in financial statements.

D3    Sustainability-related financial information is useful if it is relevant and faithfully represents what it purports to represent. Relevance and faithful representation are fundamental qualitative characteristics of useful sustainability-related financial information. The usefulness of sustainability-related financial information is enhanced if the information is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable. Comparability, verifiability, timeliness and understandability are enhancing characteristics of useful sustainability-related financial information.

## Fundamental qualitative characteristics of useful sustainability-related financial information

### Relevance

D4    Relevant sustainability-related financial information is capable of making a difference in the decisions made by primary users. Information may be capable of making a difference in a decision even if some users choose not to take advantage of it or are already aware of it from other sources. Sustainability-related financial information is capable of making a difference in decisions made by users if it has predictive value, confirmatory value or both.

D5    Sustainability-related financial information has predictive value if it can be used as an input to processes employed by primary users to predict future outcomes. Sustainability-related financial information need not be a prediction or forecast to have predictive value. Sustainability-related financial information with predictive value is employed by primary users in making their own predictions. For example, information about water quality, which

## Page 39

can include information about the water being polluted, could inform the expectations of users about the ability of an entity to meet local water-quality requirements.

D6 Sustainability-related financial information has confirmatory value if it provides feedback about (confirms or changes) previous evaluations.

D7 The predictive value and confirmatory value of sustainability-related financial information are interrelated. Information that has predictive value often also has confirmatory value. For example, information for the current year about greenhouse gas emissions, which can be used as the basis for predicting greenhouse gas emissions in future years, can also be compared with predictions about greenhouse gas emissions for the current year that were made in past years. The results of those comparisons can help a user to correct and improve the processes that were used to make those previous predictions.

Materiality

D8 Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring that information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial reports make on the basis of those reports, which provide information about a specific reporting entity. In other words, materiality is an entity-specific aspect of relevance. The materiality of information is assessed in the context of an entity's sustainability-related financial disclosures and is based on the nature or magnitude of the item to which the information relates, or both.

Faithful representation

D9 Sustainability-related financial information represents phenomena in words and numbers. To be useful, the information must not only represent relevant phenomena, it must also faithfully represent the substance of the phenomena that it purports to represent.

D10 To be a faithful representation, a depiction would be complete, neutral and accurate. The objective of general purpose financial reports is to maximise those qualities to the extent possible.

D11 A complete depiction of a sustainability-related risk or opportunity includes all material information necessary for primary users to understand that risk or opportunity.

D12 Sustainability-related financial information shall be neutral. A neutral depiction is one without bias in the selection or disclosure of information. Information is neutral if it is not slanted, weighted, emphasised, de-emphasised or otherwise manipulated to make it more likely that primary users will receive that information favourably or unfavourably. Neutral information is not information without purpose or without influence on behaviour. On the contrary, relevant information is, by definition, capable of making a difference in users' decisions.

## Page 40

# IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

D13     Some sustainability-related financial information—for example, targets or plans—is aspirational. A neutral discussion of such matters covers both aspirations and the factors that could prevent an entity from achieving these aspirations.

D14     Neutrality is supported by the exercise of prudence. Prudence is the exercise of caution when making judgements under conditions of uncertainty. The exercise of prudence means that opportunities are not overstated and risks are not understated. Equally, the exercise of prudence does not allow for the understatement of opportunities or the overstatement of risks.

D15     Sustainability-related financial information shall be accurate. Information can be accurate without being perfectly precise in all respects. The precision needed and attainable, and the factors that make information accurate, depend on the nature of the information and the nature of the matters to which it relates. For example, accuracy requires that:

(a)     factual information is free from material error;

(b)     descriptions are precise;

(c)     estimates, approximations and forecasts are clearly identified as such;

(d)     no material errors are made in selecting and applying an appropriate process for developing an estimate, approximation or forecast;

(e)     assertions and inputs used in developing estimates are reasonable and based on information of sufficient quality and quantity; and

(f)     information on judgements about the future faithfully reflects both those judgements and the information on which they are based.

## Enhancing qualitative characteristics of useful sustainability-related financial information

D16     The usefulness of sustainability-related financial information is enhanced if it is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable.

### Comparability

D17     The decisions made by the primary users of general purpose financial reports involve choosing between alternatives; for example, selling or holding an investment, or investing in one reporting entity or another. Comparability is the characteristic that enables users to identify and understand similarities in, and differences among, items. Unlike the other qualitative characteristics, comparability does not relate to a single item. A comparison requires at least two items. Information is more useful to users if it is also comparable, that is, if it can be compared with:

(a)     information provided by the entity in previous periods; and

(b)     information provided by other entities, in particular those with similar activities or operating within the same industry.

## Page 41

D18 Sustainability-related financial disclosures shall be provided in a way that enhances comparability.

D19 Consistency is related to, but is not the same as, comparability. Consistency refers to the use of the same approaches or methods for providing disclosures about the same sustainability-related risks and opportunities, from period to period, both by a reporting entity and other entities. Comparability is the goal; consistency helps to achieve that goal.

D20 Comparability is not uniformity. For information to be comparable, like things shall look alike and different things shall look different. Comparability of sustainability-related financial information is not enhanced by making unlike things look alike any more than it is enhanced by making like things look different.

Verifiability

D21 Verifiability helps to give users confidence that information is complete, neutral and accurate. Information is verifiable if it is possible to corroborate either the information itself or the inputs used to derive it. Verifiable information is more useful to primary users than information that is not verifiable.

D22 Verifiability means that various knowledgeable and independent observers could reach consensus, although not necessarily complete agreement, that a particular depiction is a faithful representation. Quantified information need not be a single point estimate to be verifiable. A range of possible amounts and the related probabilities could also be verified.

D23 Sustainability-related financial information shall be provided in a way that enhances its verifiability. Verifiability can be enhanced by, for example:

(a) including information that can be corroborated by comparing it with other information available to primary users about an entity's business, about other businesses or about the external environment in which the entity operates;

(b) providing information about inputs and methods of calculation used to produce estimates or approximations; and

(c) providing information reviewed and agreed by the entity's board, board committees or equivalent bodies.

D24 Some sustainability-related financial information will be presented as explanations or forward-looking information. That information can be supportable, for example by faithfully representing fact-based strategies, plans and risk analyses. To help primary users decide whether to use such information, an entity shall describe the underlying assumptions and methods of producing the information, as well as other factors that provide evidence that the information reflects the actual plans or decisions made by the entity.

## Page 42

# IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—JUNE 2023

## Timeliness

D25 Timeliness means having information available to decision-makers in time to be capable of influencing their decisions. Generally, the older information is, the less useful it is. However, some information may continue to be timely long after the end of a reporting period because, for example, some users may need to identify and assess trends.

## Understandability

D26 Sustainability-related financial information shall be clear and concise. For sustainability-related financial disclosures to be concise, they need:

(a) to avoid generic information, sometimes called 'boilerplate', that is not specific to the entity;

(b) to avoid duplication of information in the general purpose financial reports, including unnecessary duplication of information also provided in the related financial statements; and

(c) to use clear language and clearly structured sentences and paragraphs.

D27 The clearest form a disclosure can take will depend on the nature of the information and might include tables, graphs or diagrams in addition to narrative text. If graphs or diagrams are used, additional text or tables might be necessary to avoid obscuring material detail.

D28 Clarity might be enhanced by distinguishing information about developments in the reporting period from 'standing' information that remains unchanged, or changes little, from one period to the next—for example, by separately describing features of an entity's sustainability-related governance and risk management processes that have changed since the previous reporting period.

D29 Disclosures are concise if they include only material information. Any immaterial information included shall be provided in a way that avoids obscuring material information.

D30 Some sustainability-related risks and opportunities are inherently complex and might be difficult to present in a manner that is easy to understand. An entity shall present such information as clearly as possible. However, complex information about these risks and opportunities shall not be excluded from general purpose financial reports to make those reports easier to understand. Excluding such information would render those reports incomplete and, therefore, possibly misleading.

D31 The completeness, clarity and comparability of sustainability-related financial information all rely on information being presented as a coherent whole. For sustainability-related financial information to be coherent, it shall be presented in a way that explains the context and the connections between the related items of information.

## Page 43

D32    If sustainability-related risks and opportunities located in one part of an
       entity's general purpose financial reports have implications for information
       disclosed in other parts, the entity shall include the information necessary for
       users to assess those implications.

D33    Coherence also requires an entity to provide information in a way that allows
       users to relate information about its sustainability-related risks and
       opportunities to information in the entity's financial statements.

## Appendix E
## Effective date and transition

This appendix is an integral part of IFRS S1 and has the same authority as the other parts of the
Standard.

### Effective date

E1    An entity shall apply this Standard for annual reporting periods beginning on
      or after 1 January 2024. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies
      this Standard earlier, it shall disclose that fact and apply IFRS S2 Climate-related
      Disclosures at the same time.

E2    For the purposes of applying paragraphs E3–E6, the date of initial application
      is the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity first applies
      this Standard.

### Transition

E3    An entity is not required to provide the disclosures specified in this Standard
      for any period before the date of initial application. Accordingly, an entity is
      not required to disclose comparative information in the first annual reporting
      period in which it applies this Standard.

E4    In the first annual reporting period in which an entity applies this Standard,
      the entity is permitted to report its sustainability-related financial disclosures
      after it publishes its related financial statements. In applying this transition
      relief, an entity shall report its sustainability-related financial disclosures:

      (a)    at the same time as its next second-quarter or half-year interim general
             purpose financial report, if the entity is required to provide such an
             interim report;

      (b)    at the same time as its next second-quarter or half-year interim general
             purpose financial report, but within nine months of the end of the
             annual reporting period in which the entity first applies this Standard,
             if the entity voluntarily provides such an interim report; or

      (c)    within nine months of the end of the annual reporting period in which
             the entity first applies this Standard, if the entity is not required to and
             does not voluntarily provide an interim general purpose financial
             report.

E5    In the first annual reporting period in which an entity applies this Standard,
      the entity is permitted to disclose information on only climate-related risks
      and opportunities (in accordance with IFRS S2) and consequently apply the
      requirements in this Standard only insofar as they relate to the disclosure of
      information on climate-related risks and opportunities. If an entity uses this
      transition relief, it shall disclose that fact.

E6    If an entity uses the transition relief in paragraph E5:

## Page 45

(a) in the first annual reporting period in which the entity applies this Standard, it is not required to disclose comparative information about its climate-related risks and opportunities (see paragraph E3); and

(b) in the second annual reporting period in which the entity applies this Standard, it is not required to disclose comparative information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities, other than its climate-related risks and opportunities.
