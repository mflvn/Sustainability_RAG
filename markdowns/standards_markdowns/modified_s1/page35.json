Except as\nspecified in paragraph B51, if an entity identifies new information in relation\nto the estimated amount disclosed in the preceding period and the new\ninformation provides evidence of circumstances that existed in that period,\nthe entity shall:\n\n(a)    disclose a revised comparative amount that reflects that new\ninformation;\n\n(b)    disclose the difference between the amount disclosed in the preceding\nperiod and the revised comparative amount; and\n\n(c)    explain the reasons for revising the comparative amount.\n\nB51    In applying the requirement in paragraph B50, an entity need not disclose a\nrevised comparative amount:\n\n(a)    if it is impracticable to do so (see paragraph B54).\n\n(b)    if the metric is forward-looking.
