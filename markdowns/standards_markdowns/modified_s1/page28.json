{"page_number": 28, "text_content": "# IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\u2014JUNE 2023\n\ngeneral purpose financial reports, which provide information about a specific reporting entity.\n\nB14 The decisions of primary users relate to providing resources to the entity and involve decisions about:\n\n(a) buying, selling or holding equity and debt instruments;\n\n(b) providing or selling loans and other forms of credit; or\n\n(c) exercising rights to vote on, or otherwise influence, the entity's management's actions that affect the use of the entity's economic resources.\n\nB15 The decisions described in paragraph B14 depend on primary users' expectations about returns, for example, dividends, principal and interest payments or market price increases. Those expectations depend on primary users' assessment of the amount, timing and uncertainty of future net cash inflows to the entity and on their assessment of stewardship of the entity's economic resources by the entity's management and its governing body(s) or individual(s).\n\nB16 Assessing whether information could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions made by primary users requires consideration of the characteristics of those users and of the entity's own circumstances.\n\nB17 Sustainability-related financial disclosures are prepared for primary users who have reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and who review and analyse information diligently. At times, even well-informed and diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand sustainability-related financial information.\n\nB18 Individual primary users may have different, and sometimes even conflicting, information needs and desires. Information needs of primary users may also evolve over time. Sustainability-related financial disclosures are intended to meet common information needs of primary users.\n\n## Identifying material information\n\nB19 Materiality judgements are specific to an entity. Consequently, this Standard does not specify any thresholds for materiality or predetermine what would be material in a particular situation.\n\nB20 To identify material information about a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, an entity shall apply, as the starting point, the requirements of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to that sustainability-related risk or opportunity. In the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, the entity shall apply the requirements on sources of guidance specified in paragraphs 57\u201358. Those sources specify information, including metrics, that may be relevant to a particular sustainability-related risk or opportunity, to a particular industry or in specified circumstances."}
