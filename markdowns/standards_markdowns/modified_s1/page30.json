An entity shall not obscure material information. Information is obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar effect for primary users to omitting or misstating that information. Examples of circumstances that might result in material information being obscured include:\n\n(a)    material information is not clearly distinguished from additional information that is not material;\n\n(b)    material information is disclosed in the sustainability-related financial disclosures, but the language used is vague or unclear;\n\n(c)    material information about a sustainability-related risk or opportunity is scattered throughout the sustainability-related financial disclosures;\n\n(d)    items of information that are dissimilar are inappropriately aggregated;\n\n(e)    items of information that are similar are inappropriately disaggregated; and\n\n(f)    the understandability of the sustainability-related financial disclosures is reduced as a result of material information being hidden by immaterial information to the extent that a primary user is unable to determine what information is material.\n\nB28    An entity shall reassess its materiality judgements at each reporting date to take account of changed circumstances and assumptions. Because of changes in the entity's individual circumstances, or in the external environment, some types of information included in an entity's sustainability-related financial disclosures for prior periods might no longer be material. Conversely, some types of information not previously disclosed might become material.\n\n## Aggregation and disaggregation\n\nB29    When an entity applies IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, it shall consider all facts and circumstances and decide how to aggregate and disaggregate information in its sustainability-related financial disclosures. The entity shall not reduce the understandability of its sustainability-related financial disclosures by obscuring material information with immaterial information or by aggregating material items of information that are dissimilar to each other."}
