{"page_number": 21, "text_content": "(d) assessing whether an event or change in circumstances is significant and requires reassessment of the scope of all affected sustainability-related risks and opportunities throughout the entity's value chain (see paragraph B11).\n\n76 Other IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards may require disclosure of some of the information that an entity would otherwise be required to disclose in accordance with paragraph 74.\n\nMeasurement uncertainty\n\n77 An entity shall disclose information to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand the most significant uncertainties affecting the amounts reported in its sustainability-related financial disclosures.\n\n78 An entity shall:\n\n(a) identify the amounts that it has disclosed that are subject to a high level of measurement uncertainty; and\n\n(b) in relation to each amount identified in paragraph 78(a), disclose information about:\n\n(i) the sources of measurement uncertainty\u2014for example, the dependence of the amount on the outcome of a future event, on a measurement technique or on the availability and quality of data from the entity's value chain; and\n\n(ii) the assumptions, approximations and judgements the entity has made in measuring the amount.\n\n79 When amounts reported in sustainability-related financial disclosures cannot be measured directly and can only be estimated, measurement uncertainty arises. In some cases, an estimate involves assumptions about possible future events with uncertain outcomes. The use of reasonable estimates is an essential part of preparing sustainability-related financial disclosures and does not undermine the usefulness of the information if the estimates are accurately described and explained. Even a high level of measurement uncertainty would not necessarily prevent such an estimate from providing useful information.\n\n80 The requirement in paragraph 77 for an entity to disclose information about the uncertainties affecting the amounts reported in sustainability-related financial disclosures relates to the estimates that require the entity's most difficult, subjective or complex judgements. As the number of variables and assumptions increases, those judgements become more subjective and complex, and the uncertainty affecting the amounts reported in the sustainability-related financial disclosures increases accordingly.\n\n81 The type and extent of the information an entity might need to disclose vary according to the nature of the amount reported in the sustainability-related financial disclosures\u2014the sources of and the factors contributing to the uncertainty and other circumstances. Examples of the type of information an entity might need to disclose are:"}
