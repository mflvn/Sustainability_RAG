{"page_number": 33, "text_content": "(i) between disclosures on governance, strategy and risk\nmanagement; and\n\n(ii) between narrative information and quantitative information\n(including related metrics and targets and information in the\nrelated financial statements).\n\n(b) connections between disclosures about various sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities. For example, if an entity integrates its\noversight of sustainability-related risks and opportunities, the entity\nshall integrate the disclosures on governance instead of providing\nseparate disclosures on governance for each sustainability-related risk\nand opportunity.\n\nB42 Drawing connections between disclosures involves, but is not limited to,\nproviding necessary explanations and cross-references and using consistent\ndata, assumptions, and units of measure. In providing connected information,\nan entity shall:\n\n(a) explain connections between disclosures in a clear and concise\nmanner;\n\n(b) avoid unnecessary duplication if IFRS Sustainability Disclosure\nStandards require the disclosure of common items of information; and\n\n(c) disclose information about significant differences between the data\nand assumptions used in preparing the entity's sustainability-related\nfinancial disclosures and the data and assumptions used in preparing\nthe related financial statements.\n\nB43 For example, in providing connected information an entity might need to\nexplain the effect or likely effect of its strategy on its financial statements and\nfinancial planning, or explain how that strategy relates to the metrics the\nentity uses to measure progress against targets. Another entity might need to\nexplain how its use of natural resources or changes within its supply chain\ncould amplify or, in contrast, reduce its sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities. The entity might need to link the information about its use of\nnatural resources or changes within its supply chain to information about\ncurrent or anticipated financial effects on the entity's production costs, its\nstrategic response to mitigate those risks and its related investment in new\nassets. The entity might need to link narrative information to the related\nmetrics and targets and to information in the related financial statements.\n\nB44 Other examples of connected information include:\n\n(a) an explanation of the combined effects of the entity's sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities and its strategy on its financial\nposition, financial performance and cash flows over the short, medium\nand long term. For example, an entity might face decreasing demand\nfor its products because of consumer preferences for lower-carbon\nalternatives. The entity might need to explain how its strategic\nresponse, such as closing a major factory, could affect its workforce"}
