Information that has predictive value often also has confirmatory value. For example, information for the current year about greenhouse gas emissions, which can be used as the basis for predicting greenhouse gas emissions in future years, can also be compared with predictions about greenhouse gas emissions for the current year that were made in past years. The results of those comparisons can help a user to correct and improve the processes that were used to make those previous predictions.\n\nMateriality\n\nD8 Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring that information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial reports make on the basis of those reports, which provide information about a specific reporting entity. In other words, materiality is an entity-specific aspect of relevance. The materiality of information is assessed in the context of an entity's sustainability-related financial disclosures and is based on the nature or magnitude of the item to which the information relates, or both.\n\nFaithful representation\n\nD9 Sustainability-related financial information represents phenomena in words and numbers. To be useful, the information must not only represent relevant phenomena, it must also faithfully represent the substance of the phenomena that it purports to represent.\n\nD10 To be a faithful representation, a depiction would be complete, neutral and accurate. The objective of general purpose financial reports is to maximise those qualities to the extent possible.\n\nD11 A complete depiction of a sustainability-related risk or opportunity includes all material information necessary for primary users to understand that risk or opportunity.\n\nD12 Sustainability-related financial information shall be neutral. A neutral depiction is one without bias in the selection or disclosure of information. Information is neutral if it is not slanted, weighted, emphasised, de-emphasised or otherwise manipulated to make it more likely that primary users will receive that information favourably or unfavourably. Neutral information is not information without purpose or without influence on behaviour. On the contrary, relevant information is, by definition, capable of making a difference in users' decisions."}
