Together, the entity and the resources and relationships throughout its value chain form an interdependent system in which the entity operates. The entity's dependencies on those resources and relationships and its impacts on those resources and relationships give rise to sustainability-related risks and opportunities for the entity.\n\n3 This Standard requires an entity to disclose information about all sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital over the short, medium or long term. For the purposes of this Standard, these risks and opportunities are collectively referred to as 'sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects'.\n\n4 This Standard also prescribes how an entity prepares and reports its sustainability-related financial disclosures. It sets out general requirements for the content and presentation of those disclosures so that the information disclosed is useful to primary users in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.\n\n## Scope\n\n5 An entity shall apply this Standard in preparing and reporting sustainability-related financial disclosures in accordance with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.\n\n6 Sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could not reasonably be expected to affect an entity's prospects are outside the scope of this Standard.\n\n7 Other IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards specify information an entity is required to disclose about specific sustainability-related risks and opportunities.\n\n[^1]: Throughout this Standard, the terms 'primary users' and 'users' are used interchangeably, with the same meaning."}
