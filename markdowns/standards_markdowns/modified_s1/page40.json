{"page_number": 40, "text_content": "# IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\u2014JUNE 2023\n\nD13     Some sustainability-related financial information\u2014for example, targets or plans\u2014is aspirational. A neutral discussion of such matters covers both aspirations and the factors that could prevent an entity from achieving these aspirations.\n\nD14     Neutrality is supported by the exercise of prudence. Prudence is the exercise of caution when making judgements under conditions of uncertainty. The exercise of prudence means that opportunities are not overstated and risks are not understated. Equally, the exercise of prudence does not allow for the understatement of opportunities or the overstatement of risks.\n\nD15     Sustainability-related financial information shall be accurate. Information can be accurate without being perfectly precise in all respects. The precision needed and attainable, and the factors that make information accurate, depend on the nature of the information and the nature of the matters to which it relates. For example, accuracy requires that:\n\n(a)     factual information is free from material error;\n\n(b)     descriptions are precise;\n\n(c)     estimates, approximations and forecasts are clearly identified as such;\n\n(d)     no material errors are made in selecting and applying an appropriate process for developing an estimate, approximation or forecast;\n\n(e)     assertions and inputs used in developing estimates are reasonable and based on information of sufficient quality and quantity; and\n\n(f)     information on judgements about the future faithfully reflects both those judgements and the information on which they are based.\n\n## Enhancing qualitative characteristics of useful sustainability-related financial information\n\nD16     The usefulness of sustainability-related financial information is enhanced if it is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable.\n\n### Comparability\n\nD17     The decisions made by the primary users of general purpose financial reports involve choosing between alternatives; for example, selling or holding an investment, or investing in one reporting entity or another. Comparability is the characteristic that enables users to identify and understand similarities in, and differences among, items. Unlike the other qualitative characteristics, comparability does not relate to a single item. A comparison requires at least two items. Information is more useful to users if it is also comparable, that is, if it can be compared with:\n\n(a)     information provided by the entity in previous periods; and\n\n(b)     information provided by other entities, in particular those with similar activities or operating within the same industry."}
