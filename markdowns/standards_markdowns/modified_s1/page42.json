Generally, the older information is, the less useful it is. However, some information may continue to be timely long after the end of a reporting period because, for example, some users may need to identify and assess trends.\n\n## Understandability\n\nD26 Sustainability-related financial information shall be clear and concise. For sustainability-related financial disclosures to be concise, they need:\n\n(a) to avoid generic information, sometimes called 'boilerplate', that is not specific to the entity;\n\n(b) to avoid duplication of information in the general purpose financial reports, including unnecessary duplication of information also provided in the related financial statements; and\n\n(c) to use clear language and clearly structured sentences and paragraphs.\n\nD27 The clearest form a disclosure can take will depend on the nature of the information and might include tables, graphs or diagrams in addition to narrative text. If graphs or diagrams are used, additional text or tables might be necessary to avoid obscuring material detail.\n\nD28 Clarity might be enhanced by distinguishing information about developments in the reporting period from 'standing' information that remains unchanged, or changes little, from one period to the next\u2014for example, by separately describing features of an entity's sustainability-related governance and risk management processes that have changed since the previous reporting period.\n\nD29 Disclosures are concise if they include only material information. Any immaterial information included shall be provided in a way that avoids obscuring material information.\n\nD30 Some sustainability-related risks and opportunities are inherently complex and might be difficult to present in a manner that is easy to understand. An entity shall present such information as clearly as possible. However, complex information about these risks and opportunities shall not be excluded from general purpose financial reports to make those reports easier to understand. Excluding such information would render those reports incomplete and, therefore, possibly misleading.\n\nD31 The completeness, clarity and comparability of sustainability-related financial information all rely on information being presented as a coherent whole. For sustainability-related financial information to be coherent, it shall be presented in a way that explains the context and the connections between the related items of information."}
