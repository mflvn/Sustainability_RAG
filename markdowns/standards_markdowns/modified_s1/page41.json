{"page_number": 41, "text_content": "D18 Sustainability-related financial disclosures shall be provided in a way that enhances comparability.\n\nD19 Consistency is related to, but is not the same as, comparability. Consistency refers to the use of the same approaches or methods for providing disclosures about the same sustainability-related risks and opportunities, from period to period, both by a reporting entity and other entities. Comparability is the goal; consistency helps to achieve that goal.\n\nD20 Comparability is not uniformity. For information to be comparable, like things shall look alike and different things shall look different. Comparability of sustainability-related financial information is not enhanced by making unlike things look alike any more than it is enhanced by making like things look different.\n\nVerifiability\n\nD21 Verifiability helps to give users confidence that information is complete, neutral and accurate. Information is verifiable if it is possible to corroborate either the information itself or the inputs used to derive it. Verifiable information is more useful to primary users than information that is not verifiable.\n\nD22 Verifiability means that various knowledgeable and independent observers could reach consensus, although not necessarily complete agreement, that a particular depiction is a faithful representation. Quantified information need not be a single point estimate to be verifiable. A range of possible amounts and the related probabilities could also be verified.\n\nD23 Sustainability-related financial information shall be provided in a way that enhances its verifiability. Verifiability can be enhanced by, for example:\n\n(a) including information that can be corroborated by comparing it with other information available to primary users about an entity's business, about other businesses or about the external environment in which the entity operates;\n\n(b) providing information about inputs and methods of calculation used to produce estimates or approximations; and\n\n(c) providing information reviewed and agreed by the entity's board, board committees or equivalent bodies.\n\nD24 Some sustainability-related financial information will be presented as explanations or forward-looking information. That information can be supportable, for example by faithfully representing fact-based strategies, plans and risk analyses. To help primary users decide whether to use such information, an entity shall describe the underlying assumptions and methods of producing the information, as well as other factors that provide evidence that the information reflects the actual plans or decisions made by the entity."}
