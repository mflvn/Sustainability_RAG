Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies\n      this Standard earlier, it shall disclose that fact and apply IFRS S2 Climate-related\n      Disclosures at the same time.\n\nE2    For the purposes of applying paragraphs E3\u2013E6, the date of initial application\n      is the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity first applies\n      this Standard.\n\n### Transition\n\nE3    An entity is not required to provide the disclosures specified in this Standard\n      for any period before the date of initial application. Accordingly, an entity is\n      not required to disclose comparative information in the first annual reporting\n      period in which it applies this Standard.\n\nE4    In the first annual reporting period in which an entity applies this Standard,\n      the entity is permitted to report its sustainability-related financial disclosures\n      after it publishes its related financial statements. In applying this transition\n      relief, an entity shall report its sustainability-related financial disclosures:\n\n      (a)    at the same time as its next second-quarter or half-year interim general\n             purpose financial report, if the entity is required to provide such an\n             interim report;\n\n      (b)    at the same time as its next second-quarter or half-year interim general\n             purpose financial report, but within nine months of the end of the\n             annual reporting period in which the entity first applies this Standard,\n             if the entity voluntarily provides such an interim report; or\n\n      (c)    within nine months of the end of the annual reporting period in which\n             the entity first applies this Standard, if the entity is not required to and\n             does not voluntarily provide an interim general purpose financial\n             report.\n\nE5    In the first annual reporting period in which an entity applies this Standard,\n      the entity is permitted to disclose information on only climate-related risks\n      and opportunities (in accordance with IFRS S2) and consequently apply the\n      requirements in this Standard only insofar as they relate to the disclosure of\n      information on climate-related risks and opportunities. If an entity uses this\n      transition relief, it shall disclose that fact.\n\nE6    If an entity uses the transition relief in paragraph E5:"}
