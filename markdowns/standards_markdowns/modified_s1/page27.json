Possible data sources include the entity's risk management\nprocesses; industry and peer group experience; and external ratings, reports\nand statistics. Information that is used by the entity in preparing its financial\nstatements, operating its business model, setting its strategy and managing its\nrisks and opportunities is considered to be available to the entity without\nundue cost or effort.\n\nB10 An entity need not undertake an exhaustive search for information to identify\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be\nexpected to affect the entity's prospects. The assessment of what constitutes\nundue cost or effort depends on the entity's specific circumstances and\nrequires a balanced consideration of the costs and efforts for the entity and\nthe benefits of the resulting information for primary users. That assessment\ncan change over time as circumstances change.\n\n# Reassessment of the scope of sustainability-related risks and opportunities throughout the value chain\n\nB11 On the occurrence of a significant event or significant change in\ncircumstances, an entity shall reassess the scope of all affected sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities throughout its value chain. A significant event\nor significant change in circumstances can occur without the entity being\ninvolved in that event or change in circumstances or as a result of a change in\nwhat the entity assesses to be important to users of general purpose financial\nreports. For example, such significant events or significant changes in\ncircumstances might include:\n\n(a) a significant change in the entity's value chain (for example, a supplier\nin the entity's value chain makes a change that significantly alters the\nsupplier's greenhouse gas emissions);\n\n(b) a significant change in the entity's business model, activities or\ncorporate structure (for example, a merger or acquisition that expands\nthe entity's value chain); and\n\n(c) a significant change in an entity's exposure to sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities (for example, a supplier in the entity's value\nchain is affected by the introduction of a new regulation that the\nentity had not anticipated).\n\nB12 An entity is permitted, but not required, to reassess the scope of any\nsustainability-related risk or opportunity throughout its value chain more\nfrequently than required by paragraph B11.\n\n# Materiality (paragraphs 17\u201319)\n\nB13 Paragraph 17 requires an entity to disclose material information about the\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be\nexpected to affect the entity's prospects. Materiality of information is judged\nin relation to whether omitting, misstating or obscuring that information\ncould reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of"}
