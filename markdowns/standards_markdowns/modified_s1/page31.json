{"page_number": 31, "text_content": "B30 An entity shall not aggregate information if doing so would obscure information that is material. Information shall be aggregated if items of information have shared characteristics and shall not be aggregated if they do not have shared characteristics. The entity might need to disaggregate information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities, for example, by geographical location or in consideration of the geopolitical environment. For example, to ensure that material information is not obscured, an entity might need to disaggregate information about its use of water to distinguish between water drawn from abundant sources and water drawn from water-stressed areas.\n\n# Interaction with law or regulation\n\nB31 Law or regulation might specify requirements for an entity to disclose sustainability-related information in its general purpose financial reports. In such circumstances, the entity is permitted to include in its sustainability-related financial disclosures information to meet legal or regulatory requirements, even if that information is not material. However, such information shall not obscure material information.\n\nB32 An entity shall disclose material sustainability-related financial information, even if law or regulation permits the entity not to disclose such information.\n\nB33 An entity need not disclose information otherwise required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard if law or regulation prohibits the entity from disclosing that information. If an entity omits material information for that reason, it shall identify the type of information not disclosed and explain the source of the restriction.\n\n# Commercially sensitive information\n\nB34 If an entity determines that information about a sustainability-related opportunity is commercially sensitive in the limited circumstances described in paragraph B35, the entity is permitted to omit that information from its sustainability-related financial disclosures. Such an omission is permitted even if information is otherwise required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard and the information is material.\n\nB35 An entity qualifies for the exemption specified in paragraph B34 if, and only if:\n\n(a) information about the sustainability-related opportunity is not already publicly available;\n\n(b) disclosure of that information could reasonably be expected to prejudice seriously the economic benefits the entity would otherwise be able to realise in pursuing the opportunity; and\n\n(c) the entity has determined that it is impossible to disclose that information in a manner\u2014for example, at an aggregated level\u2014that would enable the entity to meet the objectives of the disclosure requirements without prejudicing seriously the economic benefits the entity would otherwise be able to realise in pursuing the opportunity."}
