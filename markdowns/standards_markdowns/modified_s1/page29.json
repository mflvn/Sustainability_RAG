{"page_number": 29, "text_content": "B21 An entity shall assess whether the information identified in applying paragraph B20, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of the entity's sustainability-related financial disclosures taken as a whole. In assessing whether information is material, an entity shall consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. For example, an entity might consider the magnitude and the nature of the effect of a sustainability-related risk or opportunity on the entity.\n\nB22 In some cases, IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards require the disclosure of information about possible future events with uncertain outcomes. In judging whether information about such possible future events is material, an entity shall consider:\n\n(a) the potential effects of the events on the amount, timing and uncertainty of the entity's future cash flows over the short, medium and long term (referred to as 'the possible outcome'); and\n\n(b) the range of possible outcomes and the likelihood of the possible outcomes within that range.\n\nB23 When considering possible outcomes, an entity shall consider all pertinent facts and circumstances. Information about a possible future event is more likely to be judged as being material if the potential effects are significant and the event is likely to occur. However, an entity shall also consider whether information about low-probability and high-impact outcomes might be material either individually or in combination with information about other low-probability and high-impact outcomes. For example, an entity might be exposed to several sustainability-related risks, each of which could cause the same type of disruption\u2014such as disruption to the entity's supply chain. Information about an individual source of risk might not be material if disruption from that source is highly unlikely to occur. However, information about the aggregate risk\u2014the risk of supply chain disruption from all sources \u2014might be material.\n\nB24 If a possible future event is expected to affect an entity's cash flows, but only many years in the future, information about that event is usually less likely to be judged material than information about a possible future event with similar effects that are expected to occur sooner. However, in some circumstances, an item of information could reasonably be expected to influence primary users' decisions regardless of the magnitude of the potential effects of the future event or the timing of that event. For example, this might happen if information about a particular sustainability-related risk or opportunity is highly scrutinised by primary users of an entity's general purpose financial reports.\n\nB25 An entity need not disclose information otherwise required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard if the information is not material. This is the case even if the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard contains a list of specific requirements or describes them as minimum requirements."}
