These interactions\u2014which can be direct and indirect\u2014result from operating an entity's business model in pursuit of the entity's strategic purposes and from the external environment in which the entity operates. These interactions take place within an interdependent system in which an entity both depends on resources and relationships throughout its value chain to generate cash flows and affects those resources and relationships through its activities and outputs\u2014contributing to the preservation, regeneration and development of those resources and relationships or to their degradation and depletion. These dependencies and impacts might give rise to sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity's cash flows, its access to finance and cost of capital over the short, medium and long term.\n\nB3 | For example, if an entity's business model depends on a natural resource\u2014 such as water\u2014the entity could both affect and be affected by the quality, availability and affordability of that resource. Specifically, degradation or depletion of that resource\u2014including resulting from the entity's own activities and from other factors\u2014could create a risk of disruption to the entity's operations and affect the entity's business model or strategy and could ultimately negatively affect the entity's financial performance and financial position. In contrast, regeneration and preservation of that resource\u2014 including resulting from the entity's own activities and from other factors\u2014 could positively affect the entity. Similarly, if an entity operates in a highly competitive market and requires a highly specialised workforce to achieve its strategic purposes, the entity's future success will likely depend on the entity's ability to attract and retain that resource. At the same time, that ability will depend, in part, on the entity's employment practices\u2014such as whether the entity invests in employee training and wellbeing\u2014and the levels of employee satisfaction, engagement and retention. These examples illustrate the close relationship between the value the entity creates, preserves or erodes for others and the entity's own ability to succeed and achieve its goals."}
