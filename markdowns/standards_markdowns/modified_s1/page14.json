An entity shall disclose a qualitative\n      and, if applicable, quantitative assessment of the resilience of its strategy and\n      business model in relation to its sustainability-related risks, including\n      information about how the assessment was carried out and its time horizon.\n      When providing quantitative information, an entity may disclose a single\n      amount or a range.\n\n42    Other IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards may specify the type of\n      information an entity is required to disclose about its resilience to specific\n      sustainability-related risks and how to prepare those disclosures, including\n      whether a scenario analysis is required.\n\nRisk management\n\n43    The objective of sustainability-related financial disclosures on risk\n      management is to enable users of general purpose financial reports:\n\n      (a)    to understand an entity's processes to identify, assess, prioritise and\n             monitor sustainability-related risks and opportunities, including\n             whether and how those processes are integrated into and inform\n             the entity's overall risk management process; and\n\n      (b)    to assess the entity's overall risk profile and its overall risk\n             management process.\n\n44    To achieve this objective, an entity shall disclose information about:\n\n      (a)    the processes and related policies the entity uses to identify, assess,\n             prioritise and monitor sustainability-related risks, including\n             information about:\n\n             (i)     the inputs and parameters the entity uses (for example,\n                     information about data sources and the scope of operations\n                     covered in the processes);\n\n             (ii)    whether and how the entity uses scenario analysis to inform its\n                     identification of sustainability-related risks;\n\n             (iii)   how the entity assesses the nature, likelihood and magnitude of\n                     the effects of those risks (for example, whether the entity\n                     considers qualitative factors, quantitative thresholds or other\n                     criteria);\n\n             (iv)    whether and how the entity prioritises sustainability-related\n                     risks relative to other types of risk;"}
