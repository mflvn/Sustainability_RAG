{"page_number": 19, "text_content": "# Timing of reporting\n\n64 An entity shall report its sustainability-related financial disclosures at the same time as its related financial statements. The entity's sustainability-related financial disclosures shall cover the same reporting period as the related financial statements.\n\n65 Normally, an entity prepares sustainability-related financial disclosures for a 12-month period. However, for practical reasons, some entities prefer to report, for example, for a 52-week period. This Standard does not preclude that practice.\n\n66 When an entity changes the end of its reporting period and provides sustainability-related financial disclosures for a period longer or shorter than 12 months, it shall disclose:\n\n(a) the period covered by the sustainability-related financial disclosures;\n\n(b) the reason for using a longer or shorter period; and\n\n(c) the fact that the amounts disclosed in the sustainability-related financial disclosures are not entirely comparable.\n\n67 If, after the end of the reporting period but before the date on which the sustainability-related financial disclosures are authorised for issue, an entity receives information about conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall update disclosures that relate to those conditions in the light of the new information.\n\n68 An entity shall disclose information about transactions, other events and conditions that occur after the end of the reporting period, but before the date on which the sustainability-related financial disclosures are authorised for issue, if non-disclosure of that information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that primary users of general purpose financial reports make on the basis of those reports.\n\n69 This Standard does not mandate which entities would be required to provide interim sustainability-related financial disclosures, how frequently, or how soon after the end of an interim period. However, governments, securities regulators, stock exchanges and accountancy bodies may require entities whose debt or equity securities are publicly traded to publish interim general purpose financial reports. If an entity is required or elects to publish interim sustainability-related financial disclosures in accordance with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, the entity shall apply paragraph B48.\n\n# Comparative information\n\n70 Unless another IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard permits or requires otherwise, an entity shall disclose comparative information in respect of the preceding period for all amounts disclosed in the reporting period. If such information would be useful for an understanding of the sustainability-related financial disclosures for the reporting period, the entity shall also disclose comparative information for narrative and descriptive information."}
