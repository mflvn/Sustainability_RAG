For example,\n       consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS\n       Accounting Standards provide information about the parent and its\n       subsidiaries as a single reporting entity. Consequently, that entity's\n       sustainability-related financial disclosures shall enable users of general\n       purpose financial reports to understand the effects of the sustainability-\n       related risks and opportunities on the cash flows, access to finance and cost of\n       capital over the short, medium and long term for the parent and its\n       subsidiaries.\n\nConnected information (paragraphs 21\u201324)\n\nB39    Paragraph 21 requires an entity to provide information in a manner that\n       enables users of general purpose financial reports to understand connections\n       both between the items to which the information relates and between\n       disclosures provided by the entity in its general purpose financial reports.\n\nB40    Connected information provides insight into connections between the items to\n       which the information relates. For example:\n\n       (a)    if an entity pursued a particular sustainability-related opportunity and\n              that resulted in an increase in the entity's revenue, connected\n              information will depict that relationship between the entity's strategy\n              and its financial performance;\n\n       (b)    if an entity identified a trade-off between two sustainability-related\n              risks it is exposed to and took action on the basis of its assessment of\n              that trade-off, connected information will depict the relationship\n              between those risks and the entity's strategy; and\n\n       (c)    if an entity committed to a particular sustainability-related target, but\n              that commitment has not yet affected the entity's financial position or\n              financial performance because the applicable recognition criteria have\n              not been met, connected information will depict that relationship.\n\nB41    Connected information includes:\n\n       (a)    connections between various types of information about a particular\n              sustainability-related risk or opportunity, such as:"}
