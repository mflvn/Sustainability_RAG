{"page_number": 7, "text_content": "8 An entity may apply IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards irrespective of whether the entity's related general purpose financial statements (referred to as 'financial statements') are prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards or other generally accepted accounting principles or practices (GAAP).\n\n9 This Standard uses terminology suitable for profit-oriented entities, including public-sector business entities. If entities with not-for-profit activities in the private sector or the public sector apply this Standard, they might need to amend the descriptions used for particular items of information when applying IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.\n\n# Conceptual foundations\n\n10 For sustainability-related financial information to be useful, it must be relevant and faithfully represent what it purports to represent. These are fundamental qualitative characteristics of useful sustainability-related financial information. The usefulness of sustainability-related financial information is enhanced if the information is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable. These are enhancing qualitative characteristics of useful sustainability-related financial information (see Appendix D).\n\n# Fair presentation\n\n11 A complete set of sustainability-related financial disclosures shall present fairly all sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity's prospects.\n\n12 To identify sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity's prospects, an entity shall apply paragraphs B1\u2013B12.\n\n13 Fair presentation requires disclosure of relevant information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects, and their faithful representation in accordance with the principles set out in this Standard. To achieve faithful representation, an entity shall provide a complete, neutral and accurate depiction of those sustainability-related risks and opportunities.\n\n14 Materiality is an entity-specific aspect of relevance based on the nature or magnitude, or both, of the items to which the information relates, in the context of the entity's sustainability-related financial disclosures.\n\n15 Fair presentation also requires an entity:\n\n(a) to disclose information that is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable; and\n\n(b) to disclose additional information if compliance with the specifically applicable requirements in IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards is insufficient to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand the effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities"}
