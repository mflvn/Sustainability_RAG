It describes the objective of, and the concepts that apply to, general purpose financial reports. One purpose of the Conceptual Framework is to assist the IASB to develop IFRS Accounting Standards for preparing financial statements based on consistent concepts.\n\nD2    Sustainability-related financial disclosures are part of general purpose financial reports.

Information may be capable of making a difference in a decision even if some users choose not to take advantage of it or are already aware of it from other sources. Sustainability-related financial information is capable of making a difference in decisions made by users if it has predictive value, confirmatory value or both.\n\nD5    Sustainability-related financial information has predictive value if it can be used as an input to processes employed by primary users to predict future outcomes. Sustainability-related financial information need not be a prediction or forecast to have predictive value. Sustainability-related financial information with predictive value is employed by primary users in making their own predictions. For example, information about water quality, which"}
