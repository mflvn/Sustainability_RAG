{"page_number": 43, "text_content": "# Appendix C\n# Effective date and transition\n\nThis appendix is an integral part of IFRS S2 and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.\n\n## Effective date\n\nC1    An entity shall apply this Standard for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies this Standard earlier, it shall disclose that fact and apply IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information at the same time.\n\nC2    For the purposes of applying paragraphs C3\u2013C5, the date of initial application is the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity first applies this Standard.\n\n## Transition\n\nC3    An entity is not required to provide the disclosures specified in this Standard for any period before the date of initial application. Accordingly, an entity is not required to disclose comparative information in the first annual reporting period in which it applies this Standard.\n\nC4    In the first annual reporting period in which an entity applies this Standard, the entity is permitted to use one or both of these reliefs:\n\n(a)    if, in the annual reporting period immediately preceding the date of initial application of this Standard, the entity used a method for measuring its greenhouse gas emissions other than the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004), the entity is permitted to continue using that other method; and\n\n(b)    an entity is not required to disclose its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions (see paragraph 29(a)) which includes, if the entity participates in asset management, commercial banking or insurance activities, the additional information about its financed emissions (see paragraph 29(a)(v)(2) and paragraphs B58\u2013B63).\n\nC5    If an entity uses the relief in paragraph C4(a) or paragraph C4(b), the entity is permitted to continue to use that relief for the purposes of presenting that information as comparative information in subsequent reporting periods."}
