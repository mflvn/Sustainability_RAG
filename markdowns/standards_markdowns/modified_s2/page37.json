{"page_number": 37, "text_content": "# Financed emissions\n\nB58    Entities participating in financial activities face risks and opportunities related to the greenhouse gas emissions associated with those activities. Counterparties, borrowers or investees with higher greenhouse gas emissions might be susceptible to risks associated with technological changes, shifts in supply and demand and policy change, which in turn can affect the financial institution that is providing financial services to these entities. These risks and opportunities can arise in the form of credit risk, market risk, reputational risk and other financial and operational risks. For example, credit risk might arise in relation to financing clients affected by increasingly stringent carbon taxes, fuel efficiency regulations or other policies; credit risk might also arise through technological shifts. Reputational risk might arise from financing fossil-fuel projects. Entities participating in financial activities, including commercial and investment banks, asset managers and insurance entities, are increasingly monitoring and managing such risks by measuring their financed emissions. This measurement serves as an indicator of an entity's exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities and how the entity might need to adapt its financial activities over time.\n\nB59    Paragraph 29 (a)(i)(3) requires an entity to disclose its absolute gross Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions generated during the reporting period, including upstream and downstream emissions. An entity that participates in one or more of the following financial activities is required to disclose additional and specific information about its Category 15 emissions or those emissions associated with its investments which is also known as 'financed emissions':\n\n(a)    asset management (see paragraph B61);\n\n(b)    commercial banking (see paragraph B62); and\n\n(c)    insurance (see paragraph B63).\n\nB60    An entity shall apply the requirements for disclosing greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with paragraph 29(a) when disclosing information about its financed emissions.\n\n## Asset management\n\nB61    An entity that participates in asset management activities shall disclose:\n\n(a)    its absolute gross financed emissions, disaggregated by Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n(b)    for each of the disaggregated items in paragraph B61(a), the total amount of assets under management (AUM) that is included in the financed emissions disclosure, expressed in the presentation currency of the entity's financial statements.\n\n(c)    the percentage of the entity's total AUM included in the financed emissions calculation. If the percentage is less than 100%, the entity shall disclose information that explains the exclusions, including types of assets and associated amount of AUM."}
