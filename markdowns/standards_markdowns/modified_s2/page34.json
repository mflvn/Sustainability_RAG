{"page_number": 34, "text_content": "B42    An entity's prioritisation of the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions and the entity's considerations of associated trade-offs\u2014based on the characteristics in paragraph B40\u2014requires management to apply judgement. For example, an entity might need to consider the trade-offs between timely data and data that is more representative of the jurisdiction and technology used for the value chain activity and its emissions. More recent data might provide less detail about the specific activity, including the technology that was used in the value chain and the location of that activity. On the other hand, older data that is published infrequently might be considered more representative of the specific activity and its greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nData based on direct measurement\n\nB43    Two methods are used to quantify Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions: direct measurement and estimation. Of these two methods\u2014and with all else being equal\u2014an entity shall prioritise direct measurement.\n\nB44    'Direct measurement' refers to the direct monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions and, in theory, provides the most accurate evidence. However, it is expected that Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions data will include estimation due to the challenges associated with direct measurement of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nB45    Estimation of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions involves approximate calculations of data based on assumptions and appropriate inputs. An entity that measures its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions using estimation is likely to use two types of input:\n\n(a)    data that represents the entity's activity that results in greenhouse gas emissions (activity data). For example, the entity might use distance travelled as activity data to represent the transport of goods within its value chain.\n\n(b)    emission factors that convert activity data into greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the entity will convert the distance travelled (activity data) into greenhouse gas emissions data using emission factors.\n\nData from specific activities within the entity's value chain\n\nB46    An entity's measurement of its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions will be based on data obtained directly from specific activities within the entity's value chain (primary data), data not obtained directly from activities within the entity's value chain (secondary data), or a combination of both.\n\nB47    In measuring an entity's Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, primary data is more likely to be representative of the entity's value chain activity and its greenhouse gas emissions than secondary data. Therefore, the entity shall prioritise\u2014with all else being equal\u2014the use of primary data."}
