{"page_number": 35, "text_content": "B48    Primary data for Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions includes data provided by suppliers or other entities in the value chain related to specific activities in an entity's value chain. For example, primary data could be sourced from meter readings, utility bills or other methods that represent specific activities in the entity's value chain. Primary data could be collected internally (for example, through the entity's own records), or externally from suppliers and other value chain partners (for example, supplier-specific emission factors for purchased goods or services). Data from specific activities within an entity's value chain provides a more accurate representation of the entity's specific value chain activities and, therefore, will provide a better basis for measuring the entity's Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nB49    Secondary data for Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions is data that is not obtained directly from specific activities within an entity's value chain. Secondary data is often supplied by third-party data providers and includes industry-average data (for example, from published databases, government statistics, literature studies and industry associations). Secondary data includes data used to approximate the activity or emission factors. Additionally, secondary data includes primary data from a specific activity (proxy data) used to estimate greenhouse gas emissions for another activity. If an entity uses secondary data to measure its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, it shall consider the extent to which the data faithfully represents the entity's activities.\n\nTimely data that faithfully represents the jurisdiction of, and the technology used for, the value chain activity and its greenhouse gas emissions\n\nB50    If an entity uses secondary data, it shall prioritise the use of activity or emissions data that is based on, or represents, the technology used in the value chain activity the data is intended to represent. For example, an entity might obtain primary data from its activities (for example, the specific aircraft model, distance travelled and travel-class used by employees when travelling) and would then use secondary data that represents the greenhouse gas emissions arising from those activities to convert the primary data into an estimate of its greenhouse gas emissions from air travel.\n\nB51    If an entity uses secondary data, it shall prioritise activity or emissions data that is based on, or represents, the jurisdiction in which the activity happened. For example, an entity shall prioritise emission factors that relate to the jurisdiction in which the entity operates or in which the activity has taken place.\n\nB52    If an entity uses secondary data, it shall prioritise activity or emissions data that is timely and representative of the entity's value chain activity during the reporting period. In some jurisdictions, and for some technologies, secondary data is collected annually and, therefore, the data is likely to be representative of the entity's current practice. However, some secondary data sources rely on information collected in a reporting period that is different from the entity's own reporting period."}
