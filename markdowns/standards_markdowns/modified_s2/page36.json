{"page_number": 36, "text_content": "# Verified data\n\nB53   An entity shall prioritise Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions data that is verified. Verification can provide users of general purpose financial reports with confidence that the information is complete, neutral and accurate.\n\nB54   Verified data might include data that has been internally or externally verified. Verification can take place in several ways, including on-site checking, reviewing calculations, or cross-checking of data against other sources. However, in some cases an entity might be unable to verify its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions without undue cost or effort. For example, the entity might be prevented from obtaining a complete set of verified data due to the volume of data or because the data is obtained from entities in the value chain that are separated by many tiers from the reporting entity, that is, entities that the reporting entity does not interact with directly. In such cases, an entity might need to use unverified data.\n\n# Disclosure of inputs to Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\n\nB55   An entity shall disclose information about the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions it uses to measure its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with paragraph 29(a)(iii). This disclosure shall include information about the characteristics of the data inputs as described in paragraph B40. The purpose of this disclosure is to provide users of general purpose financial reports with information about how the entity has prioritised the highest quality data available, which faithfully represents the value chain activity and its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. This disclosure also helps users of general purpose financial reports to understand why the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions the entity uses to estimate its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are relevant.\n\nB56   As part of the requirement in paragraph 29(a)(iii), and to reflect how an entity prioritises Scope 3 data in accordance with the measurement framework set out in paragraphs B40\u2013B54, the entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose financial reports to understand:\n\n(a)    the extent to which the entity's Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are measured using inputs from specific activities within the entity's value chain; and\n\n(b)    the extent to which the entity's Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are measured using inputs that are verified.\n\nB57   This Standard includes the presumption that Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions can be estimated reliably using secondary data and industry averages. In those rare cases when an entity determines it is impracticable to estimate its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, the entity shall disclose how it is managing its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Applying a requirement is impracticable when the entity cannot apply it after making every reasonable effort to do so."}
