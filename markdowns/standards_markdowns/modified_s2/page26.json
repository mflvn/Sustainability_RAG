The\n      determination of the approach shall be informed by the assessments of the\n      entity's exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities (see paragraphs\n      B4\u2013B5) and its available skills, capabilities and resources (see paragraphs\n      B6\u2013B7). Making such a determination involves:\n\n      (a)    selecting inputs to the climate-related scenario analysis (see\n             paragraphs B11\u2013B13); and\n\n      (b)    making analytical choices about how to carry out the climate-related\n             scenario analysis (see paragraphs B14\u2013B15).\n\nB9    Reasonable and supportable information includes information about past\n      events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions. It also includes\n      quantitative or qualitative information, and information that is obtained from\n      an external source or owned or developed internally.\n\nB10   An entity will need to use judgement to determine the mix of inputs and\n      analytical choices that will enable the entity to consider all reasonable and\n      supportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date\n      without undue cost or effort. The degree of judgement that is required\n      depends on the availability of detailed information. As the time horizon\n      increases and the availability of detailed information decreases, the degree of\n      judgement required increases.\n\n## Selecting inputs\n\nB11   When an entity selects the inputs to use in its climate-related scenario\n      analysis, the entity shall consider all reasonable and supportable information\n      \u2014including scenarios, variables and other inputs\u2014available to the entity at\n      the reporting date without undue cost or effort. The inputs used in scenario\n      analysis might include information that is qualitative or quantitative, and is\n      obtained from an external source or developed internally. For example,\n      publicly available climate-related scenarios\u2014from authoritative sources\u2014that\n      describe future trends and a range of pathways to plausible outcomes are\n      considered to be available to the entity without undue cost or effort.\n\nB12   When selecting scenarios, variables and other inputs to use in climate-related\n      scenario analysis, an entity might, for example, use one or more climate-\n      related scenarios\u2014including international and regional scenarios\u2014that are\n      publicly and freely available from authoritative sources. The entity shall have\n      a reasonable and supportable basis for using a particular scenario or set of\n      scenarios. For example, an entity with operations concentrated in a\n      jurisdiction where emissions are regulated\u2014or are likely to be regulated in\n      the future\u2014might determine that it is appropriate to carry out its analysis\n      using a scenario consistent with an orderly transition to a lower-carbon"}
