{"page_number": 31, "text_content": "# The measurement approach set out in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\n\nB27 The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) includes different measurement approaches that an entity might use when measuring its greenhouse gas emissions. In disclosing information in accordance with paragraph 29(a)(iii), the entity is required to disclose information about the measurement approach it uses. For example, when the entity discloses its greenhouse gas emissions measured in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004), the entity is required to use the equity share or control approach. Specifically, the entity shall disclose:\n\n(a) the approach it uses to determine its greenhouse gas emissions (for example, the equity share or control approach in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004)); and\n\n(b) the reason, or reasons, for the entity's choice of measurement approach and how that approach relates to the disclosure objective in paragraph 27.\n\n# Other methods and measurement approaches\n\nB28 When an entity discloses its greenhouse gas emissions measured in accordance with another method, applying paragraphs 29(a)(ii), B24\u2013B25 or C4(a), the entity shall disclose:\n\n(a) the applicable method and measurement approach the entity uses to determine its greenhouse gas emissions; and\n\n(b) the reason, or reasons, for the entity's choice of method and measurement approach and how that approach relates to the disclosure objective in paragraph 27.\n\n# Emission factors\n\nB29 As part of an entity's disclosure of the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions, the entity shall disclose information to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand which emission factors the entity uses in its measurement of its greenhouse gas emissions. This Standard does not specify emission factors an entity is required to use in its measurement of its greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, this Standard requires an entity to use emission factors that best represent the entity's activity as its basis for measuring its greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n# Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions\n\nB30 Paragraph 29(a)(v) requires an entity to disclose its location-based Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and provide information about any contractual instruments the entity has entered into that could inform users' understanding of the entity's Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. For the avoidance of doubt, an entity is required to disclose its Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions using a location-based approach and is required to provide information about contractual instruments only if such instruments exist and"}
