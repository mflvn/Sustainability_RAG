Paragraphs B2\u2013B18 provide guidance on how an entity uses\nscenario analysis to assess the entity's climate resilience. Specifically:\n\n(a)    paragraphs B2\u2013B7 set out the factors the entity shall consider when\nassessing its circumstances;\n\n(b)    paragraphs B8\u2013B15 set out the factors the entity shall consider when\ndetermining an appropriate approach to climate-related scenario\nanalysis; and\n\n(c)    paragraphs B16\u2013B18 set out additional factors for the entity to\nconsider when determining its approach to climate-related scenario\nanalysis over time.\n\n## Assessing the circumstances\n\nB2    An entity shall use an approach to climate-related scenario analysis that is\ncommensurate with its circumstances as at the time the entity carries out its\nclimate-related scenario analysis (see paragraph B3). To assess its\ncircumstances the entity shall consider:\n\n(a)    the entity's exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities (see\nparagraphs B4\u2013B5); and\n\n(b)    the skills, capabilities and resources available to the entity for the\nclimate-related scenario analysis (see paragraphs B6\u2013B7).\n\nB3    An entity shall assess its circumstances each time it carries out its climate-\nrelated scenario analysis. For example, an entity that carries out its climate-\nrelated scenario analysis every three years to align with its strategic planning\ncycle (see paragraph B18) would be required to reconsider for this purpose its\nexposure to climate-related risks and opportunities and the skills, capabilities\nand resources available at that time.\n\n---\n\n2 This application guidance (paragraphs B1\u2013B18) draws on the range of practice outlined in\ndocuments published by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD),\nincluding Technical Supplement: The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate-related Risks and\nOpportunities (2017) and Guidance on Scenario Analysis for Non-Financial Companies (2020)."}
