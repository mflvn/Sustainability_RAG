{"page_number": 28, "text_content": "B17    An entity might use a simpler approach to climate-related scenario analysis, \n       such as qualitative scenario narratives, if such an approach is appropriate to \n       the entity's circumstances. For example, if an entity does not currently have \n       the skills, capabilities or resources to carry out quantitative climate-related \n       scenario analysis but has a high degree of exposure to climate-related risk, the \n       entity might initially use a simpler approach to climate-related scenario \n       analysis, but would build its capabilities through experience and, therefore, \n       would apply a more advanced quantitative approach to climate-related \n       scenario analysis over time. An entity with a high degree of exposure to \n       climate-related risks and opportunities, and with access to the necessary skills, \n       capabilities or resources, is required to apply a more advanced quantitative \n       approach to climate-related scenario analysis.\n\nB18    Although paragraph 22 requires an entity to disclose information about its \n       climate resilience at each reporting date, the entity might carry out its \n       climate-related scenario analysis in line with its strategic planning cycle, \n       including a multi-year strategic planning cycle (for example, every three to \n       five years). Therefore, in some reporting periods the entity's disclosures in \n       accordance with paragraph 22(b) could remain unchanged from the previous \n       reporting period if the entity does not conduct a scenario analysis annually. \n       The entity shall\u2014at a minimum\u2014update its climate-related scenario analysis \n       in line with its strategic planning cycle. However, an assessment of the entity's \n       resilience is required to be carried out annually to reflect updated insight into \n       the implications of climate uncertainty for the entity's business model and \n       strategy. As such, an entity's disclosure in accordance with paragraph 22(a)\u2014\n       that is, the results of the entity's resilience assessment\u2014shall be updated at \n       each reporting period."}
