Carbon credits are uniquely serialised, issued, tracked and cancelled by means of an electronic registry. |\n| climate resilience | The capacity of an entity to adjust to climate-related changes, developments or uncertainties. Climate resilience involves the capacity to manage climate-related risks and benefit from climate-related opportunities, including the ability to respond and adapt to climate-related transition risks and climate-related physical risks. An entity's climate resilience includes both its strategic resilience and its operational resilience to climate-related changes, developments and uncertainties. |\n| climate-related physical risks | Risks resulting from climate change that can be event-driven (acute physical risk) or from longer-term shifts in climatic patterns (chronic physical risk). Acute physical risks arise from weather-related events such as storms, floods, drought or heatwaves, which are increasing in severity and frequency. Chronic physical risks arise from longer-term shifts in climatic patterns including changes in precipitation and temperature which could lead to sea level rise, reduced water availability, biodiversity loss and changes in soil productivity.\n\nThese risks could carry financial implications for an entity, such as costs resulting from direct damage to assets or indirect effects of supply-chain disruption. The entity's financial performance could also be affected by changes in water availability, sourcing and quality; and extreme temperature changes affecting the entity's premises, operations, supply chains, transportation needs and employee health and safety. |\n| climate-related risks and opportunities | Climate-related risks refers to the potential negative effects of climate change on an entity. These risks are categorised as climate-related physical risks and climate-related transition risks.\n\nClimate-related opportunities refers to the potential positive effects arising from climate change for an entity. Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change can produce climate-related opportunities for an entity. |\n| climate-related transition plan | An aspect of an entity's overall strategy that lays out the entity's targets, actions or resources for its transition towards a lower-carbon economy, including actions such as reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. |"}
