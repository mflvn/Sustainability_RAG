For example, although an entity shall provide the information required by paragraph 25, if oversight of sustainability-related risks and opportunities is managed on an integrated basis, the entity would avoid duplication by providing integrated risk management disclosures instead of separate disclosures for each sustainability-related risk and opportunity."}
