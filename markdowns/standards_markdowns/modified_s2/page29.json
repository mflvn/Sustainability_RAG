Such a difference would mean that greenhouse gas emissions information from these entities in its value chain for the entity's reporting period might not be readily available for the entity to use for its own disclosure. In such circumstances, the entity is permitted to measure its greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with paragraph 29(a)(i) using information for reporting periods that are different from its own reporting period if that information is obtained from entities in its value chain with reporting periods that are different from the entity's reporting period, on the condition that:\n\n(a) the entity uses the most recent data available from those entities in its value chain without undue cost or effort to measure and disclose its greenhouse gas emissions;\n\n(b) the length of the reporting periods is the same; and\n\n(c) the entity discloses the effects of significant events and changes in circumstances (relevant to its greenhouse gas emissions) that occur between the reporting dates of the entities in its value chain and the date of the entity's general purpose financial reports.\n\n### Aggregation of greenhouse gases into CO\u2082 equivalent using global warming potential values\n\nB20 Paragraph 29(a) requires an entity to disclose its absolute gross greenhouse gas emissions generated during the reporting period, expressed as metric tonnes of CO\u2082 equivalent. To meet this requirement, the entity shall aggregate the seven constituent greenhouse gases into CO\u2082 equivalent values.\n\nB21 If an entity uses direct measurement to measure its greenhouse gas emissions, the entity is required to convert the seven constituent greenhouse gases into a CO\u2082 equivalent value using global warming potential values based on a 100-year time horizon, from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment available at the reporting date.\n\nB22 If an entity uses emission factors to estimate its greenhouse gas emissions, the entity shall use\u2014as its basis for measuring its greenhouse gas emissions\u2014the emission factors that best represent the entity's activity (see paragraph B29). If these emission factors have already converted the constituent gases into CO\u2082 equivalent values, the entity is not required to recalculate the emission factors using global warming potential values based on a 100-year time horizon from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment available at the reporting date. However, if an entity uses emission factors that are not"}
