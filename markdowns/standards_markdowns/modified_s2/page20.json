Transition risks include policy, legal, technological, market and reputational risks. These risks could carry financial implications for an entity, such as increased operating costs or asset impairment due to new or amended climate-related regulations. The entity's financial performance could also be affected by shifting consumer demands and the development and deployment of new technology. |\n| CO\u2082 equivalent | The universal unit of measurement to indicate the global warming potential of each greenhouse gas, expressed in terms of the global warming potential of one unit of carbon dioxide. This unit is used to evaluate releasing (or avoiding releasing) different greenhouse gases against a common basis. |\n| financed emissions | The portion of gross greenhouse gas emissions of an investee or counterparty attributed to the loans and investments made by an entity to the investee or counterparty. These emissions are part of Scope 3 Category 15 (investments) as defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (2011). |\n| global warming potential | A factor describing the radiative forcing impact (degree of harm to the atmosphere) of one unit of a given greenhouse gas relative to one unit of CO\u2082. |\n| greenhouse gases | The seven greenhouse gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol\u2014 carbon dioxide (CO\u2082); methane (CH\u2084); nitrous oxide (N\u2082O); hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083); perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF\u2086). |\n| indirect greenhouse gas emissions | Emissions that are a consequence of the activities of an entity, but occur at sources owned or controlled by another entity. |\n| internal carbon price | Price used by an entity to assess the financial implications of changes to investment, production and consumption patterns, and of potential technological progress and future emissions-abatement costs. An entity can use internal carbon prices for a range of business applications. Two types of internal carbon prices that an entity commonly uses are:\n\n(a) a shadow price, which is a theoretical cost or notional amount that the entity does not charge but that can be used to understand the economic implications or trade-offs for such things as risk impacts, new investments, the net present value of projects, and the cost and benefit of various initiatives; and"}
