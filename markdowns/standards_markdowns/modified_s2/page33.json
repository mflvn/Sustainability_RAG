{"page_number": 33, "text_content": "B35 An entity is permitted, but not required, to reassess the scope of any climate-related risk or opportunity throughout its value chain more frequently than required by paragraph B11 in IFRS S1.\n\nB36 In accordance with paragraph B6(b) in IFRS S1, to determine the scope of the value chain, which includes its breadth and composition, an entity shall use all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort.\n\nB37 An entity that participates in one or more financial activities associated with asset management, commercial banking and insurance shall disclose additional information about the financed emissions associated with those activities as part of the entity's disclosure of its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions (see paragraphs B58\u2013B63).\n\nScope 3 measurement framework\n\nB38 An entity's measurement of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions is likely to include the use of estimation rather than solely comprising direct measurement. In measuring Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions an entity shall use a measurement approach, inputs and assumptions that result in a faithful representation of this measurement. The measurement framework described in paragraphs B40\u2013B54 provides guidance for an entity to use in preparing its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions disclosures.\n\nB39 An entity is required to use all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort when the entity selects the measurement approach, inputs and assumptions it uses in measuring Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nB40 An entity's measurement of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions relies upon a range of inputs. This Standard does not specify the inputs the entity is required to use to measure its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, but does require the entity to prioritise inputs and assumptions using these identifying characteristics (which are listed in no particular order):\n\n| (a) | data based on direct measurement (paragraphs B43\u2013B45); |\n|-----|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| (b) | data from specific activities within the entity's value chain (paragraphs B46\u2013B49); |\n| (c) | timely data that faithfully represents the jurisdiction of, and the technology used for, the value chain activity and its greenhouse gas emissions (paragraphs B50\u2013B52); and |\n| (d) | data that has been verified (paragraphs B53\u2013B54). |\n\nB41 An entity is required to apply the Scope 3 measurement framework to prioritise inputs and assumptions even when the entity is required by a jurisdictional authority or an exchange on which the entity is listed to use a method other than the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) for measuring its greenhouse gas emissions (see paragraphs B24\u2013B25), or whether the entity uses the transition relief described in paragraph C4(a)."}
