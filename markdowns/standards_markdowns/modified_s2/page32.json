Various types of contractual instruments are available in\n       different markets and the entity might disclose information about its market-\n       based Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions as part of its disclosure.\n\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\n\nB32    In accordance with paragraph 29(a)(vi), an entity shall disclose information\n       about its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions to enable users of general purpose\n       financial reports to understand the source of these emissions. The entity shall\n       consider its entire value chain (upstream and downstream) and shall consider\n       all 15 categories of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, as described in the\n       Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and\n       Reporting Standard (2011). In accordance with paragraph 29(a)(vi), the entity\n       shall disclose which of these categories are included in its Scope 3 greenhouse\n       gas emissions disclosures.\n\nB33    For the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the method an entity uses to\n       measure its greenhouse gas emissions, the entity is required to disclose the\n       categories included within its measure of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions as\n       described in paragraph 29(a)(vi)(1).\n\nB34    In accordance with paragraph B11 in IFRS S1, on the occurrence of a\n       significant event or a significant change in circumstances, an entity shall\n       reassess the scope of all affected climate-related risks and opportunities\n       throughout its value chain, including reassessing which Scope 3 categories\n       and entities throughout its value chain to include in the measurement of its\n       Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. A significant event or significant change in\n       circumstances can occur without the entity being involved in that event or\n       change in circumstances or as a result of a change in what the entity assesses\n       to be important to users of general purpose financial reports. For example,\n       such significant events or significant changes in circumstances might include:\n\n       (a)    a significant change in the entity's value chain (for example, a supplier\n              in the entity's value chain makes a change that significantly alters the\n              supplier's greenhouse gas emissions);\n\n       (b)    a significant change in the entity's business model, activities or\n              corporate structure (for example, a merger or acquisition that expands\n              the entity's value chain); and\n\n       (c)    a significant change in the entity's exposure to climate-related risks\n              and opportunities (for example, a supplier in the entity's value chain is\n              affected by the introduction of an emissions regulation that the entity\n              had not anticipated)."}
