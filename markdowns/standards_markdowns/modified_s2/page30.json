For the avoidance of doubt, an\n       entity shall apply the requirements in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A\n       Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) only to the extent that\n       they do not conflict with the requirements in this Standard. For example, the\n       Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard\n       (2004) does not require an entity to disclose its Scope 3 greenhouse gas\n       emissions, however, the entity is required to disclose Scope 3 greenhouse gas\n       emissions in accordance with paragraph 29(a).\n\nB24    An entity is required to use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate\n       Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) unless the entity is required by a\n       jurisdictional authority or an exchange on which it is listed to use a different\n       method for measuring its greenhouse gas emissions. If the entity is required\n       by a jurisdictional authority or an exchange on which it is listed to use a\n       different method for measuring its greenhouse gas emissions, the entity is\n       permitted to use this method rather than using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol:\n       A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) for as long as the\n       jurisdictional or exchange requirement applies to the entity.\n\nB25    In some circumstances, an entity might be subject to a requirement in the\n       jurisdiction in which it operates to disclose its greenhouse gas emissions for a\n       specific part of the entity or for some of its greenhouse gas emissions (for\n       example, only for Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions). In such\n       circumstances, the jurisdictional requirement does not exempt the entity\n       from applying the requirements in this Standard to disclose the entity's Scope\n       1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions for the entity as a whole.\n\nMeasurement approach, inputs and assumptions\n\nB26    Paragraph 29(a)(iii) requires an entity to disclose the measurement approach,\n       inputs and assumptions it uses to measure its greenhouse gas emissions. As\n       part of this requirement, the entity shall include information about:\n\n       (a)    the measurement approach the entity uses in accordance with the\n              Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting\n              Standard (2004) (see paragraph B27);\n\n       (b)    the applicable method if the entity is not using the Greenhouse Gas\n              Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) and\n              the measurement approach the entity uses (see paragraph B28); and\n\n       (c)    the emission factors the entity uses (see paragraph B29)."}
