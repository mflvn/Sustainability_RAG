{"page_number": 17, "text_content": "(h) how the latest international agreement on climate change, including jurisdictional commitments that arise from that agreement, has informed the target.\n\n34 An entity shall disclose information about its approach to setting and reviewing each target, and how it monitors progress against each target, including:\n\n(a) whether the target and the methodology for setting the target has been validated by a third party;\n\n(b) the entity's processes for reviewing the target;\n\n(c) the metrics used to monitor progress towards reaching the target; and\n\n(d) any revisions to the target and an explanation for those revisions.\n\n35 An entity shall disclose information about its performance against each climate-related target and an analysis of trends or changes in the entity's performance.\n\n36 For each greenhouse gas emissions target disclosed in accordance with paragraphs 33\u201335, an entity shall disclose:\n\n(a) which greenhouse gases are covered by the target.\n\n(b) whether Scope 1, Scope 2 or Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are covered by the target.\n\n(c) whether the target is a gross greenhouse gas emissions target or net greenhouse gas emissions target. If the entity discloses a net greenhouse gas emissions target, the entity is also required to separately disclose its associated gross greenhouse gas emissions target (see paragraphs B68\u2013B69).\n\n(d) whether the target was derived using a sectoral decarbonisation approach.\n\n(e) the entity's planned use of carbon credits to offset greenhouse gas emissions to achieve any net greenhouse gas emissions target. In explaining its planned use of carbon credits the entity shall disclose information including, and with reference to paragraphs B70\u2013B71:\n\n(i) the extent to which, and how, achieving any net greenhouse gas emissions target relies on the use of carbon credits;\n\n(ii) which third-party scheme(s) will verify or certify the carbon credits;\n\n(iii) the type of carbon credit, including whether the underlying offset will be nature-based or based on technological carbon removals, and whether the underlying offset is achieved through carbon reduction or removal; and"}
