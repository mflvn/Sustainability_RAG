{"page_number": 25, "text_content": "Exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nB4    An entity shall consider its exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities \n      in its assessment of its circumstances and when determining the approach to \n      use for its climate-related scenario analysis. This consideration provides \n      essential context for understanding the potential benefits of using a particular \n      approach to climate-related scenario analysis. For example, if an entity has a \n      high degree of exposure to climate-related risk then a more quantitative or \n      technically sophisticated approach to climate-related scenario analysis would \n      be of greater benefit to the entity and users of general purpose financial \n      reports. Users of general purpose financial reports would be less likely to \n      benefit from quantitative or technically sophisticated climate-related scenario \n      analysis if the entity is exposed to few or relatively less severe climate-related \n      risks and opportunities. This means that\u2014with all else being equal\u2014the \n      greater the entity's exposure to climate-related risks or opportunities, the \n      more likely it is the entity would determine that a more technically \n      sophisticated form of climate-related scenario analysis is required.\n\nB5    This Standard requires an entity to identify the climate-related risks and \n      opportunities to which it is exposed (see paragraph 10) and to disclose \n      information about the process the entity uses to identify, assess, prioritise and \n      monitor those risks and opportunities (see paragraph 25). The information the \n      entity discloses in accordance with paragraphs 10 and 25 can inform the \n      entity's consideration of its exposure to climate-related risks and \n      opportunities.\n\nSkills, capabilities and resources available\n\nB6    An entity shall consider the available skills, capabilities and resources when \n      determining an appropriate approach to use for its climate-related scenario \n      analysis. These skills, capabilities and resources might include both internal \n      and external skills, capabilities and resources. The entity's available skills, \n      capabilities and resources provide context to inform its consideration of the \n      potential cost and level of effort required by a particular approach to climate-\n      related scenario analysis. For example, if an entity has only just begun to \n      explore the use of climate-related scenario analysis to assess its climate \n      resilience, it might be unable to use a quantitative or technically sophisticated \n      approach to climate-related scenario analysis without undue cost or effort. For \n      the avoidance of doubt, if resources are available to the entity then it will be \n      able to invest in obtaining or developing the necessary skills and capabilities.\n\nB7    Climate-related scenario analysis can be resource intensive and might\u2014\n      through an iterative learning process\u2014be developed and refined over multiple \n      planning cycles. As an entity repeats the climate-related scenario analysis, it is \n      likely to develop skills and capabilities that will enable the entity to \n      strengthen its approach to climate-related scenario analysis over time. For \n      example, if an entity has not yet used climate-related scenario analysis or \n      participates in an industry where climate-related scenario analysis is not \n      commonly used, the entity might need more time to develop its skills and \n      capabilities. In contrast, an entity in an industry where climate-related \n      scenario analysis is established practice\u2014such as extractives and mineral "}
