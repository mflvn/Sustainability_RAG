{"page_number": 41, "text_content": "# Climate-related targets (paragraphs 33\u201337)\n\n## Characteristics of a climate-related target\n\nB66\tParagraph 33 requires an entity to disclose the quantitative or qualitative climate-related targets it has set, and any it is required to meet by law or regulation, including any greenhouse gas emissions targets. In disclosing these climate-related targets, the entity is required to disclose information about the characteristics of these targets as described in paragraph 33(a)\u2013(h). If the climate-related target is quantitative, an entity is required to describe whether the target is an absolute target or an intensity target. An absolute target is defined as a total amount of a measure or a change in the total amount of a measure, whereas an intensity target is defined as a ratio of a measure, or a change in the ratio of a measure, to a business metric.\n\nB67\tIn identifying and disclosing the metric used to set a climate-related target and measure progress, an entity shall consider the cross-industry metrics and industry-based metrics. If the metric has been developed by the entity to measure progress towards a target, the entity shall disclose information about that metric in accordance with paragraph 50 of IFRS S1.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions targets\n\n### Gross and net greenhouse gas emissions targets\n\nB68\tIf an entity has a greenhouse gas emissions target, the entity is required to specify whether the target is a gross greenhouse gas emissions target or a net greenhouse gas emissions target. Gross greenhouse gas emissions targets reflect the total changes in greenhouse gas emissions planned within the entity's value chain. Net greenhouse gas emissions targets are the entity's targeted gross greenhouse gas emissions minus any planned offsetting efforts (for example, the entity's planned use of carbon credits to offset its greenhouse gas emissions).\n\nB69\tParagraph 36(c) specifies that if an entity has a net greenhouse gas emissions target it is required to also disclose a gross greenhouse gas emissions target. For the avoidance of doubt, if the entity discloses a net greenhouse gas emissions target, this target cannot obscure information about its gross greenhouse gas emissions targets.\n\n## Carbon credits\n\nB70\tParagraph 36(e) requires an entity to describe its planned use of carbon credits \u2014which are transferable or tradeable instruments\u2014to offset emissions to achieve any net greenhouse gas emissions targets the entity has set, or any it is required to meet by law or regulation. Any information about the planned use of carbon credits shall clearly demonstrate the extent to which these carbon credits are relied on to achieve the net greenhouse gas emissions targets."}
