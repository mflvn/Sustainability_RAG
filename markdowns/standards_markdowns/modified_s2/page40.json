These connections include consistency in the data and assumptions used\u2014to the extent possible\u2014and linkages between the amounts disclosed in accordance with paragraph 29(b)\u2013(g) and the amounts recognised and disclosed in the financial statements. For example, an entity would consider whether the carrying amount of assets used is consistent with amounts included in the financial statements and would explain the connections between information in these disclosures and amounts in the financial statements."}
