Elsewhere, for example, an entity\nwith heightened exposure to physical climate-related risks might determine\nthat it is appropriate to carry out its analysis using a localised climate-related\nscenario that takes into account current policies.\n\nB13    In considering whether the selected inputs are reasonable and supportable, an\nentity shall consider the objective of paragraph 22, which requires the entity\nto disclose information that enables users of general purpose financial reports\nto understand the resilience of the entity's strategy and business model to\nclimate-related changes, developments and uncertainties, taking into\nconsideration the entity's identified climate-related risks and opportunities.\nThis means that the inputs to the entity's climate-related scenario analysis\nshall be relevant to the entity's circumstances, for example, to the particular\nactivities the entity undertakes and the geographical location of those\nactivities.\n\nMaking analytical choices\n\nB14    An entity's resilience assessment will be informed not only by the individual\ninputs to its climate-related scenario analysis, but also by the information it\ndevelops in combining those inputs to carry out the analysis. The entity shall\nprioritise the analytical choices (for example, whether to use qualitative\nanalysis or quantitative modelling) that will enable it to consider all\nreasonable and supportable information that is available to the entity at the\nreporting date without undue cost or effort. For example, if an entity is able\u2014\nwithout undue cost or effort\u2014to incorporate multiple carbon price pathways\nassociated with a given outcome (for example, a 1.5 degree Celsius outcome),\nthis analysis is likely to strengthen the entity's resilience assessment,\nassuming such an approach is warranted by the entity's risk exposure.\n\nB15    Quantitative information will often enable an entity to carry out a more\nrobust assessment of its climate resilience. However, qualitative information\n(including scenario narratives), either alone or combined with quantitative\ndata, can also provide a reasonable and supportable basis for the entity's\nresilience assessment.\n\nAdditional considerations\n\nB16    Climate-related scenario analysis is an evolving practice and, therefore, the\napproach that an entity uses is likely to change over time. As described in\nparagraphs B2\u2013B7, the entity shall determine its approach to climate-related\nscenario analysis based on its particular circumstances, including the entity's\nexposure to climate-related risks and opportunities and the skills, capabilities\nand resources available for the scenario analysis. Those circumstances are also\nlikely to change over time. Therefore, the entity's approach to climate-related\nscenario analysis need not be the same from one reporting period or strategic\nplanning cycle to the next (see paragraph B18)."}
