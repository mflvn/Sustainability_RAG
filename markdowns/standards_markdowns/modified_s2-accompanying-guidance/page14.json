{"page_number": 14, "text_content": "IE35    The entity considers how to disclose information about its financed emissions. In making its decision, the entity considers that:\n\n(a)     the long-term bond portfolios seek long-term capital appreciation (average holding period of seven years) and the publicly traded equity portfolios seek short-term capital appreciation (average holding period of nine months).\n\n(b)     its assessment of the climate-related risks affecting these two asset classes differs because each asset class is affected differently by climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n(c)     the entity's portfolios within each asset class are similar in their composition and risk exposure to the entity's other portfolios within the same asset class. This is true for both asset classes: long-term bonds and publicly traded equities.\n\nIE36    Although IFRS S2 does not explicitly require disaggregation of an entity's financed emissions by long-term bonds and publicly traded equities, the entity considers the requirement in IFRS S1 that prohibits information from being aggregated if doing so would obscure information that is material.\n\nIE37    For the reasons outlined in paragraphs IE35\u2013IE36, the entity decides that disaggregating information about its financed emissions, specifically related to long-term bonds and publicly traded equities, is necessary to provide material information to users of general purpose financial reports.\n\nIE38    The entity disaggregates its financed emissions by asset class, as illustrated in Table 8.\n\nTable 8: Financed emissions disclosure disaggregated by asset class\n\nFinanced emissions (metric tonnes CO\u2082e)\n\n| | Long-term bonds | Publicly traded equities | Total |\n|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------|\n| Scope 1 | 48,600,415 | 101,487,332 | 150,087,747 |\n| Scope 2 | 33,805,025 | 27,187,765 | 60,992,790 |\n| Scope 3 | 159,615,008 | 301,001,718 | 460,616,726 |\n| Total reported | 242,020,448 | 429,676,815 | 671,697,263 |\n| AUM (in CU) included | 22.15bn | 36.65bn | 58.8bn |\n| % of total AUM included (% of asset class-specific AUM included) | 36.9% (98%) | 61.1% (98%) | 98% (N/A) |\n\nNote A: 2.0% of AUM, or CU1.2bn, is excluded from the financed emissions calculation, which represents cash held in the funds."}
