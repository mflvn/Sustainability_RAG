{"page_number": 12, "text_content": "IE27    As an asset manager, the entity is required by IFRS S2 to provide information about the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its total AUM. The entity calculates the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its seven corporate bond portfolios and includes the portfolio emissions for 98% of its total AUM in its calculation. The remaining 2% of its total AUM, or CU220 million, is cash. The entity does not disclose any portfolio emissions associated with this cash. The entity discloses Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions at the total AUM level.\n\nIE28    The entity considers how to disclose information about its financed emissions. In making its decision, the entity considers that:\n\n(a)     the entity's portfolios within each of the active and passive strategy groupings are highly similar in their composition and risk exposure.\n\n(b)     the active strategies have higher total fees than the passive strategies and contribute significantly more to the entity's revenue. This dynamic is not expected to change.\n\n(c)     the greenhouse gas emissions of its active strategies are significantly lower than those of its passive strategies.\n\nIE29    Additionally, the portfolio emissions of the entity's active strategies better reflect its climate-related risk analysis because the entity's passive strategies track the performance and holdings of a benchmark, whereas its active strategies seek to outperform a benchmark. While both strategies face the risk of poor performance, the entity also identifies differing risk exposures between active and passive strategies as its active strategies may face outflows from underperforming a benchmark, but those strategies also have greater flexibility in managing or reducing their financed emissions compared to the entity's passive strategies.\n\nIE30    Although IFRS S2 does not explicitly require disaggregation of an entity's financed emissions by active and passive strategies, the entity considers the requirement in IFRS S1 that prohibits information from being aggregated if doing so would obscure information that is material.\n\nIE31    For the reasons outlined in paragraphs IE28\u2013IE30, the entity decides that disaggregating information about its financed emissions, specifically related to active and passive strategies, is necessary to provide material information to users of general purpose financial reports.\n\nIE32    The entity disaggregates its portfolio emissions by active and passive strategies, as illustrated in Table 6."}
