It measures its Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. The entity considers how to disclose information about its Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions. In making its decision, the entity considers that:\n\n(a)     a jurisdiction in which it operates has introduced stringent regulations on the oil and gas industry relating to methane emissions arising from production;\n\n(b)     the entity is required to refer to and consider the applicability of *Volume 11\u2014Oil & Gas Exploration & Production* of the *Industry-based Guidance on Implementing IFRS S2*, which includes guidance on the separate disclosure of percentage of gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions from methane emissions;\n\n(c)     the entity's risk function has determined that Scope 1 methane emissions from oil and gas production is widely scrutinised by regulators and, if not managed, could pose high reputational and regulatory risks; and\n\n(d)     the entity has made process improvements to reduce Scope 1 methane emissions, thus reducing the risk of potential regulatory liabilities.\n\nIE16    Although IFRS S2 does not explicitly require disaggregation by constituent greenhouse gases, the entity considers the requirement in IFRS S1 that prohibits information from being aggregated if doing so would obscure information that is material.\n\nIE17    For the reasons outlined in paragraphs IE15 and IE16, the entity determines that disaggregating information about its Scope 1 methane emissions is necessary to provide material information to users of general purpose financial reports.\n\nIE18    The entity discloses its greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with paragraph 29(a) of IFRS S2 and decides to include a table to supplement the disclosure of its Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions, as illustrated in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Disclosure excerpt of Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions disaggregated by constituent gas\n\n| Greenhouse gas emissions (metric tonnes CO\u2082e) | 20X1 | 20X0 |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Methane                                        | 23,000 | 24,000 |\n\n# Example 3B: Disaggregation of a Scope 3 category by constituent gases\n\nIE19    For simplicity, this example illustrates only an entity's considerations related to its use-phase emissions (Scope 3 Category 11), and, specifically, its CO\u2082 and nitrogen oxide (N\u2082O) emissions. Considerations related to other Scope 3 categories and other constituent gases are ignored."}
