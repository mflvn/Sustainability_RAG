However, the responsibility for making materiality judgements and determinations rests with the reporting entity for all requirements in IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards and for all accompanying guidance, including this guidance. An entity is required to disclose information if it concludes that the information is material to users in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.\n\nIB7 | The disclosure topics and associated metrics in the industry-based guidance are not exhaustive. IFRS S2 requires an entity to consider the full range of climate-related risks and opportunities it faces, including any not identified in this guidance. The entity is required to describe those climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital over the short, medium or long term ('climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects'), in accordance with paragraph 10(a) of IFRS S2. Accordingly, an entity might need to provide information related to additional topics not included in the industry-based guidance\u2014as well as associated metrics\u2014used by the entity to meet the requirements of IFRS S2. The additional information would be particularly necessary if an entity faces climate-related risks or opportunities that are emerging rapidly or associated with unique aspects of its business model or circumstances.\n\n## Selecting the appropriate industry (or industries)\n\nIB8 | The industry-based guidance is organised according to the Sustainable Industry Classification System* (SICS*). When preparing disclosures in accordance with the industry-based guidance, an entity is required to identify the particular volume(s) it has applied in preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures, in accordance with paragraph 59(b) of IFRS S1. As a starting point, an entity can identify its primary industry classification on the SASB Standards website.\n\nIB9 | Some entities participate in a range of activities that are likely to span more than one industry. For entities whose operations are integrated horizontally across industries (such as conglomerates) or vertically through the value chain, more than one volume of industry-based guidance may be necessary for completeness. Using more than one volume of industry-based guidance would allow such an entity to detail the full range of climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects."}
