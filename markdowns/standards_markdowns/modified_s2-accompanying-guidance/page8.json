{"page_number": 8, "text_content": "IE9 In relation to Category 11\u2014use of sold products, the entity considers that:\n\n(a) it has a three-year plan to improve the emission efficiency of its products that will reduce the greenhouse gas emissions arising when customers use the products the entity sells (use-phase emissions); and\n\n(b) its greenhouse gas emissions in this category account for more than 25% of its total disclosed Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIE10 Although IFRS S2 does not explicitly require disaggregation of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by category, the entity considers the requirement in IFRS S1 that prohibits information from being aggregated if doing so would obscure information that is material.\n\nIE11 For the reasons outlined in paragraphs IE8\u2013IE10, the entity determines that disaggregating information about its Scope 3 Category 1 greenhouse gas emissions and its Scope 3 Category 11 greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to provide material information to users of general purpose financial reports.\n\nIE12 The entity decides to include a table to supplement the disclosure of its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, as illustrated in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Disclosure excerpt of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions disaggregated between Category 1 and Category 11\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)\n\n| | 20X1 | 20X0 |\n|---|---|---|\n| Category 1\u2014Purchased goods and services | 34,000 | 35,000 |\n| Category 11\u2014Use of sold products | 13,000 | 14,600 |\n\nExample 3\u2014Disaggregating greenhouse gas emissions by constituent greenhouse gases\n\nIE13 Examples 3A and 3B illustrate the disaggregation of an entity's absolute greenhouse gas emissions by constituent greenhouse gases. Although IFRS S2 does not explicitly require such disaggregation, an entity is required to apply the principles of aggregation and disaggregation set out in IFRS S1 (paragraphs B29\u2013B30).\n\nExample 3A: Disaggregation of Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by constituent gas\n\nIE14 For simplicity, this example illustrates only an entity's considerations related to methane emissions. Considerations related to other constituent gases are ignored."}
