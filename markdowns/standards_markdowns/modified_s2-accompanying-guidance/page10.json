{"page_number": 10, "text_content": "IE20    An entity operates in the automobile industry. It measures its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. The entity considers how to disclose information about its use-phase emissions (Scope 3 Category 11 greenhouse gas emissions). In making its decision, the entity considers that a substantial proportion of these greenhouse gas emissions occurs from combustion and tailpipe emissions when the cars are driven on the road. These use-phase emissions\u2014specifically, CO\u2082 and N\u2082O\u2014are subject to stringent regulation in several important jurisdictions where the entity's cars are sold. Based on this consideration, the entity determines that information about its use-phase emissions is material.\n\nIE21    The entity then also considers circumstances related to CO\u2082 and N\u2082O emissions, including:\n\n(a)     government-funded subsidies have been introduced in important market jurisdictions and will be available to entities in the automotive industry. The subsidies will fund the production of vehicles that emit lower levels of N\u2082O. Therefore, the entity is incentivised to produce vehicles that meet the N\u2082O emissions limits in these jurisdictions.\n\n(b)     the entity is required to refer to and consider the applicability of Volume 63\u2014Automobiles of the Industry-based Guidance on Implementing IFRS S2 that includes metrics for sales-weighted average passenger fleet fuel economy, including the grams of CO\u2082 per kilometre for passenger cars.\n\n(c)     the entity is required to refer to and consider the applicability of Volume 63\u2014Automobiles of the Industry-based Guidance on Implementing IFRS S2 that includes guidance on the separate disclosure of information about the entity's strategy for reducing use-phase emissions such as CO\u2082 and N\u2082O, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter.\n\n(d)     the entity measures, manages and monitors use-phase CO\u2082 and N\u2082O emissions when designing and manufacturing its vehicles. It has set internal targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and a portion of the executive team's variable remuneration is linked to achieving these targets.\n\nIE22    Although not explicitly required by IFRS S2 to disaggregate Scope 3 Category 11 greenhouse gas emissions by constituent greenhouse gases, the entity considers the requirement in IFRS S1 that prohibits information from being aggregated if doing so would obscure information that is material."}
