{"text_content": "# Illustrative Examples\n\nThese examples accompany, but are not part of, IFRS S2. They illustrate aspects of IFRS S2 but are not intended to provide interpretative guidance.\n\nIE1 These examples set out hypothetical situations illustrating how an entity might apply some of the requirements in IFRS S2. The analysis in each example is not intended to represent the only manner in which the requirements could be applied, nor are the examples intended to apply only to the specific industries illustrated. For illustrative purposes, the examples use simple fact patterns. When making disclosures in accordance with IFRS S2, an entity would need to consider all relevant facts and the specific circumstances of a particular fact pattern.\n\n# Aggregation and disaggregation of greenhouse gas emissions\n\nIE2 Examples 1\u20135 illustrate some considerations when determining if it is necessary to disaggregate information when disclosing greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the requirements of IFRS S2. These examples do not illustrate all reasons that could be necessary to disaggregate information when disclosing greenhouse gas emissions. Where relevant, these examples refer to IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information (IFRS S1), the Industry-based Guidance on Implementing IFRS S2 and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) (GHG Protocol Corporate Standard).\n\n# Example 1\u2014Disaggregating Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions between the consolidated accounting group and other investees\n\nIE3 Example 1 illustrates the requirements in paragraph 29(a)(i)\u2013(iv) to disclose and disaggregate Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions between an entity's consolidated accounting group and its investees not included in the consolidated accounting group.\n\nIE4 The entity applies the equity share approach, as outlined in the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, to set its organisational boundary for the purposes of measuring its greenhouse gas emissions. The entity applies IFRS Accounting Standards and has one investment that it accounts for as an investment in an associate. Applying the equity share approach, the entity determines its Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions to be 7,350 metric tonnes CO\u2082 equivalent (CO\u2082e), and its Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions to be 1,320 CO\u2082e.\n\nIE5 Table 1 illustrates the disaggregation of the total Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions disclosed by the entity when it applies paragraph 29(a)(iv).\n", "page_number": 6}
