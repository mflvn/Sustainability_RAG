For example, the entity would use the associated\nmetrics, including the fuel economy of the entity's fleet (metric TR-\nAU-410a.1) and its sales of zero-emission vehicles (metric TR-AU-410a.2).\nThese disclosures would help fulfil the industry-based requirements and\nthose related to metrics and targets. However, the entity might also use the\ndisclosures to fulfil the requirement in paragraph 14(c) of IFRS S2 to disclose\nquantitative information about the progress of plans disclosed in accordance\nwith paragraph 14(a) of IFRS S2. This information would help users\nunderstand how the entity plans to achieve the climate-related targets it has\nset.\n\nPreparing information to fulfil cross-industry metric\ncategories\n\nIB14    The industry-based guidance can assist entities in meeting the requirements\n        for disclosures related to cross-industry metric categories in paragraphs\n        29(a)\u2013(e) of IFRS S2. For example:\n\n        (a)     paragraph 29(a) requires the disclosure of the entity's gross Scope 1\n                greenhouse gas emissions, which an entity in the semiconductors\n                industry might enhance by disclosing the amount of Scope 1\n                greenhouse gas emissions from perfluorinated compounds (see metric\n                TC-SC-110a.1);\n\n        (b)     paragraph 29(c) requires the disclosure of quantitative information\n                related to an entity's exposure to climate-related physical risk, which\n                an entity in the agricultural products industry might fulfil by\n                disclosing the percentage of key crops sourced from water-stressed\n                regions (see metric FB-AG-440a.2);\n\n        (c)     paragraph 29(d) requires the disclosure of quantitative information\n                related to an entity's climate-related opportunities, which an entity in\n                the chemicals industry might fulfil by disclosing its revenue from\n                products designed for use-phase resource efficiency (see metric RT-\n                CH-410a.1); and\n\n        (d)     paragraph 29(e) requires the disclosure of quantitative information\n                about an entity's climate-related capital deployment, which an entity\n                in the oil and gas industry might fulfil by disclosing the amount it has\n                invested in renewable energy (see metric EM-EP-420a.3).\n\nIB15    Regardless of whether a preparer identifies a direct or explicit connection\n        between a specific cross-industry metric category and a given industry-based\n        disclosure topic or its corresponding metric(s), the entity shall refer to and\n        consider the applicability of its full set of relevant industry-based guidance to"}
