For simplicity, this example illustrates only an entity's considerations related to how it presents its disclosures of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from purchased goods and services (Category 1) and its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from use of sold products (Category 11).\n\nIE7 An entity applies paragraph B32 of IFRS S2. It measures its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from purchased goods and services and use of products sold in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. The entity considers whether disaggregation of its Category 1 and Category 11 Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions is required to meet the requirements in IFRS S1 (paragraphs B29\u2013B30).\n\nIE8 In relation to Category 1\u2014purchased goods and services, the entity considers that:\n\n(a) its greenhouse gas emissions in relation to this category account for 60% of its total disclosed Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions;\n\n(b) it has committed to achieving a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 20Y0, and reducing Category 1 greenhouse gas emissions is a priority to achieving this target;\n\n(c) it has set specific greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets for reducing Category 1 greenhouse gas emissions; and\n\n(d) its supply chain is located in jurisdictions with nationally determined contributions, and, as a result, suppliers are subject to increasingly strict emissions-related regulations and taxation policies."}
