It illustrates aspects of IFRS S2 but is not intended to provide interpretative guidance.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIB1    This guidance suggests possible ways to apply some of the disclosure requirements in IFRS S2. The guidance does not create additional requirements. Specifically, the guidance suggests ways to identify and disclose information about climate-related risks and opportunities associated with particular business models, activities or other common features that characterise participation in an industry. In applying IFRS S2, an entity is required to refer to and consider the applicability of the information set out in this guidance, in accordance with paragraphs 12 and 32 of IFRS S2.\n\nIB2    This industry-based guidance has been derived from Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards, which are maintained by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). Because the guidance is industry-based, only a subset is likely to apply to any entity.\n\n## Structure and terminology\n\nIB3    This guidance is organised by industry to assist an entity in identifying the climate-related risks and opportunities that are applicable to its business model and associated activities.\n\nIB4    The industry-based guidance contains:\n\n(a)    industry descriptions\u2014which are intended to help entities identify applicable industry guidance by describing the business models, activities and other common features that characterise participation in the industry;\n\n(b)    disclosure topics\u2014which describe specific climate-related risks or opportunities associated with the activities conducted by entities within a particular industry;\n\n(c)    metrics\u2014which accompany disclosure topics and are designed to, either individually or as part of a set, provide useful information regarding an entity's performance for a specific disclosure topic;\n\n(d)    technical protocols\u2014which provide guidance on definitions, scope, implementation and presentation of associated metrics; and\n\n(e)    activity metrics\u2014which quantify the scale of specific activities or operations by an entity and are intended for use in conjunction with the metrics referred to in paragraph IB4(c) to normalise data and facilitate comparison."}
