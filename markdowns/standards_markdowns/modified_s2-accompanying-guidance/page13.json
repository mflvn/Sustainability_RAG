The entity calculates the emissions associated with its eight portfolios and includes the financed emissions for 98% of its total AUM in its calculation. The remaining 2% of AUM, or CU1.2bn, is cash. The entity does not disclose any financed emissions associated with this cash. The entity discloses these greenhouse gas emissions by Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions at the total AUM level."}
