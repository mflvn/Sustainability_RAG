An entity that has, in a prior reporting period, used SASB Standards to prepare disclosures will find that the guidance is consistent with SASB Standards. Such consistency includes the:\n\n(a)     industry classifications;\n\n(b)     disclosure topics;\n\n(c)     metrics and technical protocols; and\n\n(d)     activity metrics.\n\nIB11    Where applicable, the industry-based guidance is accompanied by the relevant SASB metric code to assist preparers who have previously used SASB Standards.\n\n## Identifying risks and opportunities and preparing disclosures\n\nIB12    Paragraph 10 of IFRS S2 requires an entity to identify and describe the climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's prospects, including those associated with one or more particular business models, activities or other common features that characterise participation in an industry. In fulfilling the industry-based disclosure requirement, preparers are required to refer to and consider the applicability of the industry-based guidance as a starting point for identifying climate-related risks and opportunities. In particular, the disclosure topics in this guidance describe specific climate-related risks or opportunities associated with the activities conducted by entities within a particular industry.\n\nExample 1\n\nAn entity in the automobiles industry might review the guidance and determine that the disclosure topic on 'Fuel Economy and Use-phase Emissions' is applicable to its circumstances. The disclosure topic notes that '[M]otor vehicle fossil fuel combustion accounts for a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions contributing to global climate change' and that '[m]ore stringent emissions standards and changing consumer demands are driving electric vehicle and hybrid market expansion, as well as for high fuel-efficiency conventional vehicles.' Accordingly, the disclosure topic could describe either a transition risk\u2014if the entity takes action to mitigate the risk of changing buyer preferences and adapt its business model\u2014or a climate-related opportunity\u2014if the entity innovates to meet or exceed regulatory standards and capture an increasing share of an evolving market.\n\nIB13    Paragraphs 13\u201322 of IFRS S2 require an entity to provide additional information on the climate-related risks and opportunities identified and described in paragraph 10 of IFRS S2. In preparing its climate-related financial disclosures, an entity is required to refer to and consider the applicability of"}
