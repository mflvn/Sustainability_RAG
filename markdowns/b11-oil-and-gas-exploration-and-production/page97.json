{"page_number": 97, "text_content": "1.1    Scope 1 emissions are defined according to The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).\n\n1.2    The scope of GHG emissions includes the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083).\n\n2    The entity shall discuss its emission reduction target(s) and analyze its performance against the target(s), including the following, where relevant:\n\n2.1    The scope of the emission reduction target (e.g., the percentage of total emissions to which the target is applicable);\n\n2.2    Whether the target is absolute- or intensity-based, and the metric denominator, if it is an intensity-based target;\n\n2.3    The percentage reduction against the base year, with the base year representing the first year against which emissions are evaluated towards the achievement of the target;\n\n2.4    The timelines for the reduction activity, including the start year, the target year, and the base year;\n\n2.5    The mechanism(s) for achieving the target; and\n\n2.6    Any circumstances in which the target or base year emissions have been, or may be, recalculated retrospectively or the target or base year has been reset which may include, but are not limited to energy efficiency efforts, energy source diversification, carbon capture and storage, or the implementation of leak detection and repair processes.\n\n3    The entity shall discuss activities and investments required to achieve the plans and/or targets, and any risks or limiting factors that might affect achievement of the plans and/or targets.\n\n4    The entity shall discuss the scope of its strategies, plans, and/or reduction targets, such as whether they pertain differently to different business units, geographies, or emissions sources.\n\n4.1    Categories of emissions sources may include:\n\n4.1.1    Flared hydrocarbons, including all emissions emitted from flares and which are associated with the management and disposal of unrecoverable natural gas via combustion of hydrocarbon products from routine operations, upsets, or emergencies\n\n4.1.2    Other combusted emissions, including, but not limited to: (1) emissions from stationary devices, including, but not limited to boilers, heaters, furnaces, reciprocating internal combustion engines and turbines, incinerators, and thermal/catalytic oxidizers,"}
