However, primary disclosure shall be according to the guidelines described above.\n\n7 The entity may discuss the calculation methodology for its emissions disclosure, such as if data are from continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS), engineering calculations, or mass balance calculations.\n\nEM-EP-110a.2. Amount of gross global Scope 1 emissions from: (1) flared hydrocarbons, (2) other combustion, (3) process emissions, (4) other vented emissions, and (5) fugitive emissions\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in CO2-e from the following sources (1) flared hydrocarbons, (2) other combustion, (3) process emissions, (4) other vented emissions, and (5) fugitive emissions from operations.\n\n1.1 Flared hydrocarbons shall include all emissions emitted from flares and which are associated with the management and disposal of unrecoverable natural gas via combustion of hydrocarbon products from routine operations, upsets, or emergencies.\n\n1.2 Other combusted emissions shall include, but are not limited to:\n\n1.2.1 Emissions from stationary devices, including, but not limited to boilers, heaters, furnaces, reciprocating internal combustion engines and turbines, incinerators, and thermal/catalytic oxidizers"}
