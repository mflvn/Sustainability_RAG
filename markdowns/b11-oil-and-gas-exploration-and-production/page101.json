Percentage of hydraulic fracturing sites where ground or surface water quality deteriorated compared to a baseline\n\n1    The entity shall calculate the percentage as: the total number of hydraulic fracturing well sites for which it detected a deterioration in the ground or surface water surrounding the well site as compared to a baseline measurement, divided by the total number of hydraulic fracturing well sites.\n\n2    Deterioration in water quality is, at a minimum, defined as occurring when testing indicates:\n\n2.1    Presence of thermogenic gas or a mixture of thermogenic and biogenic gas that was not present in baseline testing.\n\n2.2    An increase in methane concentration by more than 5.0 mg/l between sampling periods.\n\n2.3    Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, or xylenes (BTEX compounds) or total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) are present in higher concentrations as compared to the baseline.\n\n3    The entity shall determine whether water quality deteriorated against a baseline through monitoring of ground and surface water surrounding hydraulically fractured well sites.\n\n3.1    Determinations shall be consistent with Chapter 3 of the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (WOGCC) Rules and Regulations, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission's (COGCC) Rule 609 \u2014 Statewide Groundwater Baseline Sampling and Monitoring, or a jurisdictional equivalent.\n\n3.2    The entity shall disclose the jurisdictional standard, guideline, or regulation used for its calculation.\n\n4    The initial baseline sample shall occur:\n\n4.1    Prior to drilling or before installation of a surface oil and gas facility on a location\n\n4.2    Prior to re-stimulation of a well, if more than 12 months have passed since the initial pre-drilling sampling event or the most recent re-stimulation sampling event\n\n5    Ongoing monitoring shall occur with at least the following frequency:\n\n5.1    One subsequent sampling between 12 and 18 months after well completion or facility installation", "page_number": 101}
