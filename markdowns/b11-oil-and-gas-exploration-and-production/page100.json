{"page_number": 100, "text_content": "4 The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn.\n\n5 The entity shall disclose its water consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water consumed.\n\nEM-EP-140a.2. Volume of produced water and flowback generated; percentage (1) discharged, (2) injected, (3) recycled; hydrocarbon content in discharged water\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the volume, in thousands of cubic meters, of produced water and flowback fluid generated during its activities.\n\n2 Produced water is defined as water (brine) obtained from the hydrocarbon bearing formation strata during the extraction of oil and gas. This can include formation water, injection water, and any chemicals added downhole or during the oil/water separation process.\n\n3 Flowback is defined as the recovered hydraulic fracturing fluid that returns to the surface during a hydraulic fracturing operation that may often be mixed with produced water.\n\n4 The entity shall calculate the percentage of produced water and flowback fluid that was:\n\n4.1 Discharged directly to the environment or indirectly discharged through a third party, such as a local wastewater treatment plant;\n\n4.2 Injected;\n\n4.3 Recycled for use in other wells in fracturing fluids or in other drilling and production processes.\n\n5 The entity shall disclose the amount, in metric tons, of hydrocarbons water that was discharged to the environment.\n\n5.1 The scope of disclosure includes produced water, flowback, process water, storm water, or other water that was discharged to the environment.\n\n5.2 Measurements of hydrocarbon content should be made using test methods required or approved by local regulatory authorities (or equivalent applicable standards).\n\nEM-EP-140a.3. Percentage of hydraulically fractured wells for which there is public disclosure of all fracturing fluid chemicals used\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of hydraulically fractured wells for which there is public disclosure of all fracturing fluid chemicals used.\n\n1.1 The percentage shall be calculated as the number of hydraulically fractured wells for which it provides public disclosure of all of the chemical content of fracturing fluid, divided by the total number of hydraulically fractured wells."}
