Estimated carbon dioxide emissions embedded in proved hydrocarbon reserves\n\n1 The entity shall calculate and disclose an estimate of the carbon dioxide emissions embedded in its proved hydrocarbon reserves.\n\n1.1 Nota bene \u2014 this estimate applies a factor for potential CO\u2082 only and does not include an estimate for all potential greenhouse gas emissions, as these are dependent on downstream use (e.g., utility electricity generation, industrial heating and electricity generation, residential heating and cooling, transportation, or use in petrochemicals, agrochemicals, asphalt, and lubricants).\n\n2 Estimated potential carbon dioxide emissions from proved hydrocarbon reserves shall be calculated according to the following formula, derived from Meinshausen et al.:\n\n2.1 E = R \u00d7 V \u00d7 C, where:\n\n2.1.1 E are the potential emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide (kg CO\u2082);\n\n2.1.2 R are the proved reserves in gigagrams (Gg);\n\n2.1.3 V is the net calorific value in terajoules per gigagram (TJ/Gg); and\n\n2.1.4 C is the effective carbon dioxide emission factor in kilograms CO\u2082 per terajoule (kg/TJ).\n\n3 In the absence of data specific to the entity's hydrocarbon reserves, carbon content shall be calculated using default data for each major hydrocarbon resource published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\n\n3.1 The entity shall use default carbon content values per unit of energy that is listed in IPCC Table 1.3 Default Values of Carbon Content, Volume 2: Energy, Chapter 1.\n\n3.2 The entity shall use calorific values per weight of hydrocarbon contained in IPCC Table 1.2 Default Net Calorific Values (NCVs) and Lower and Upper Limit of the 95% Confidence Intervals, Volume 2: Energy, Chapter 1.\n\n4 The entity shall use engineering estimates to determine the weight of its hydrocarbons reserves in gigagrams.\n\n5 For other assumptions required to estimate the carbon content of hydrocarbon reserves, the entity shall rely on guidance from the IPCC, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, or the International Energy Agency (IEA)."}
