Sensitivity of Reserves to Prices by Principal Product Type and Price Scenario**\n\n| PRICE CASE | PROVED RESERVES | PROBABLE RESERVES |\n|-------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| (Scenario) | Oil (MMbbls) | Gas (MMscf) (MSm\u00b3) | Product:A (measure) | Oil (MMbbls) | Gas (MMscf) (MSm\u00b3) | Product:A (measure) |\n| Current Policies Scenario (base) | | | | | | |\n| New Policies Scenario | | | | | | |\n| Sustainable Development Scenario | | | | | | |\n\n5 The entity may disclose the sensitivity of its reserve levels in other price and demand scenarios in addition to those described above, particularly if these scenarios differ depending on the type of hydrocarbon reserves, regulatory environment in the countries or regions where exploration occurs, end-use of the entity's products, or other factors.\n\n6 For additional sensitivity analyses, the entity should consider disclosing the following, per the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Recommendations Report Figure 8 as well as the Implementing the Recommendations of the TCFD Report, Section E:\n\n6.1 The alternative scenarios used, including other 2\u00b0C or lower scenarios.\n\n6.2 Critical input parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices for the climate-related scenarios used, particularly as they relate to key areas such as policy assumptions, energy deployment pathways, technology pathways, and related timing assumptions.", "page_number": 104}
