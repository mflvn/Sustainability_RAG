{"page_number": 103, "text_content": "# Reserves Valuation & Capital Expenditures\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nEstimates suggest that exploration and production (E&P) companies may be unable to extract a significant proportion of their proved and probable oil and gas reserves if greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are to be controlled to limit global temperature increases to two degrees Celsius as per the Paris Agreement. Companies with more carbon-intensive reserves and production and higher capital costs are likely to face greater risks. Regulatory limits on GHG emissions, together with improved competitiveness of alternative energy technologies, could lower or reduce the growth in global demand, and therefore reduce prices for oil and gas products. Extraction costs could increase with regulations that put a price on GHG emissions. These factors could affect the economic viability to extract oil and gas reserves. Regulatory actions that are more abrupt than anticipated, or those focusing on industries with high emissions, could impair asset values over a short period of time. Stewardship of capital resources and production decisions that take into account near- and long-term trends related to climate change mitigation actions can help prevent current asset impairment and maintain profitability and creditworthiness.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-EP-420a.1. Sensitivity of hydrocarbon reserve levels to future price projection scenarios that account for a price on carbon emissions\n\n1 The entity shall perform a sensitivity analysis of its reserves to determine how several future scenarios may affect its determination of whether the reserves are proved or probable.\n\n2 The entity shall analyze the sensitivity of its current proven and probable reserves using the price trajectories published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its World Energy Outlook (WEO) publication, including:\n\n2.1 Current Policies Scenario, which assumes no changes in policies from the mid-point of the year of publication of the WEO.\n\n2.2 New Policies Scenario, which assumes that broad policy commitments and plans that have been announced by countries (including national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and plans to phase out fossil-energy subsidies), occur even if the measures to implement these commitments have yet to be identified or announced. This broadly serves as the IEA baseline scenario.\n\n2.3 Sustainable Development Scenario, which assumes that an energy pathway occurs that is consistent with the goal of limiting the global increase in temperature to 1.5\u00b0C by limiting concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\n2.4 The entity shall consider the WEO scenarios as a normative reference, thus any updates to the WEO made year-on-year shall be considered updates to this guidance."}
