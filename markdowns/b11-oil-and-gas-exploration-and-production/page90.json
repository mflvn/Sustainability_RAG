{"page_number": 90, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nOil & Gas - Exploration & Production (E&P) companies explore for, extract, or produce energy products such as crude oil and natural gas, which comprise the upstream operations of the oil and gas value chain. Companies in the industry develop conventional and unconventional oil and gas reserves; these include, but are not limited to, shale oil and/or gas reserves, oil sands, and gas hydrates. Activities covered by this standard include the development of both on-shore and off-shore reserves. The E&P industry creates contracts with the Oil and Gas Services industry to conduct several E&P activities and to obtain equipment and oilfield services.\n\nNote: The Standards discussed below are for \"pure-play\" E&P activities, or independent E&P companies. Integrated oil and gas companies conduct upstream operations but are also involved in the distribution and/or refining or marketing of products. SASB has separate standards for the Oil and Gas Midstream (EM-MD) and Refining & Marketing industries (EM-RM). As such, integrated companies should also consider the disclosure topics and metrics from these standards. SASB also has separate standards for Oil and Gas Services (EM-SV)."}
