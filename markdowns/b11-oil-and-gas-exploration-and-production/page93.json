{"text_content": "# Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nExploration & Production (E&P) activities generate significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a variety of sources. Emissions can be combusted, including those arising from flaring or power generation equipment, as well as uncombusted, including those emissions arising from gas processing equipment, venting, flaring, and fugitive methane. Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG emissions in response to the risks posed by climate change may result in additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for E&P companies. With natural gas production from shale resources expanding, the management of the emission of methane, a highly potent GHG, from oil and gas E&P systems has emerged as a major operational, reputational, and regulatory risk for companies. Furthermore, the development of unconventional hydrocarbon resources may be more or less GHG-intensive than conventional oil and gas, with associated impacts to regulatory risk. Energy efficiency, use of less carbon-intensive fuels, or process improvements to reduce fugitive emissions, venting, and flaring, can provide benefits to E&P companies in the form of climate risk mitigation, lower costs, or increased revenues.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-EP-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage methane, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations\n\n1 The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083).\n\n1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\u2082-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).\n\n1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.\n\n2 Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).\n\n2.1 These emissions include direct emissions of GHGs from stationary or mobile sources; these sources include but are not limited to: equipment at well sites, production facilities, refineries, chemical plants, terminals, fixed site drilling rigs, office buildings, marine vessels transporting products, tank truck fleets, mobile drilling rigs, and moveable equipment at drilling and production facilities.", "page_number": 93}
