Contamination of local water resources can result from incidents involving produced water, flowback water, hydraulic fracturing fluids, and other well fluids. Historically, there has been concern regarding the impacts of hydraulic fracturing operations on the contamination of groundwater supplies. Reducing water use and contamination through recycling, other water management strategies, and use of non-toxic fracturing fluids could create operational efficiency for companies and lower their operating costs. Such strategies could also minimize the impacts that regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions have on operations.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-EP-140a.1. (1) Total fresh water withdrawn, (2) total fresh water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from freshwater sources:\n\n1.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local statutes and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no regulatory definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n1.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose the amount of fresh water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.\n\n2.1 Water consumption is defined as:\n\n2.1.1 Water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge;\n\n2.1.2 Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service;\n\n2.1.3 Water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea.\n\n3 The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40-80%) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct."}
