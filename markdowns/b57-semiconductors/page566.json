GHG emissions can create regulatory compliance costs and operating risks for semiconductors companies, although resulting financial impacts will vary depending on the magnitude of emissions and the prevailing emissions regulations. Companies that cost-effectively manage GHG emissions through greater energy efficiency, the use of alternative chemicals, or manufacturing process advances could benefit from improved operating efficiency and reduced regulatory risk.\n\n## Metrics\n\nTC-SC-110a.1. (1) Gross global Scope 1 emissions and (2) amount of total emissions from perfluorinated compounds\n\n1 The entity shall disclose its (1) gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol \u2014carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).\n\n1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e), calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).\n\n1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose its (2) gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions, in metric tons of CO2-e, originated from perfluorinated compounds.\n\n3 Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).\n\n3.1 Acceptable calculation methodologies include those that conform to the GHG Protocol as the base reference, but provide additional guidance, such as industry- or region-specific guidance. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n3.1.1 GHG Reporting Guidance for the Aerospace Industry published by International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG)\n\n3.1.2 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidance: Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)"}
