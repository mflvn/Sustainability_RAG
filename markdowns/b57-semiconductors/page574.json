Processor energy efficiency at a system-level for: (1) servers, (2) desktops, and (3) laptops\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the energy efficiency of its processors based on benchmarked performance per watt of energy consumed for (1) servers, (2) desktops, and (3) laptops, using the following parameters:\n\n1.1 Representative product: The entity shall calculate performance using a representative product for each product category (i.e., servers, desktops, laptops), where representative product would typically be the entity's bestselling specification of processor in the product category. If the entity determines its representative product differently, it shall explain the criteria it used in this determination.\n\n1.2 System-level testing: Testing shall be conducted\u2014and disclosure shall be made\u2014at the system-level for a computer integrating the entity's processor and not at a component-level. The entity shall conduct testing using a representative computer system structure, such as the bestselling system using the entity's processor or one that is widely commercially available.\n\n1.3 Specified benchmark: At a minimum the entity shall disclose performance to the benchmarks defined below for each product category; the entity may disclose performance to additional benchmarks.\n\n2 As described below, the entity shall conduct testing and disclose performance, depending on product category, consistent with guidance provided by:\n\n2.1 The Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC)\n\n2.2 MobileMark\u00ae\n\n3 For (1) servers the entity shall conduct testing according to the SPEC Power SPECpower_ssj2008 and disclose the results as: overall ssj_ops/watt\n\n4 For (2) desktop computers the entity shall conduct testing according to the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark and disclose results as both:\n\n4.1 SPECspeed2017_int_base score/watt\n\n4.2 SPECspeed2017_fp_basescore/watt"}
