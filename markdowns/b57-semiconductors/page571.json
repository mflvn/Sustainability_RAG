As manufacturing becomes more complex, companies in the industry are finding it important to reduce the use of ultra-pure water. Water is becoming a scarce resource around the world, due to increasing consumption from population growth and rapid urbanization, and reduced supplies due to climate change. Furthermore, water pollution in developing countries makes available water supplies unusable or expensive to treat. Without careful planning, water scarcity can result in higher supply costs, social tensions with local communities and governments, and/or loss of access to water in water-scarce regions thereby presenting a critical risk to production. Semiconductor companies that are able to increase the efficiency of water use during manufacturing will maintain a lower risk profile and face lower regulatory risks as local, regional, and national environmental laws place increasing emphasis on resource conservation.\n\n## Metrics\n\nTC-SC-140a.1. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1    The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources.\n\n1.1    Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities.\n\n2    The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources.\n\n2.1    Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n2.2    Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n3    The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.\n\n3.1    Water consumption is defined as:\n\n3.1.1    Water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge;\n\n3.1.2    Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service;"}
