However, primary disclosure shall be according to the guidelines described above.\n\n6 The entity may discuss the calculation methodology for its emissions disclosure, such as if data are from continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS), engineering calculations, or mass balance calculations.\n\nTC-SC-110a.2. Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets\n\n1 The entity shall discuss its long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage its Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\n1.1 Scope 1 emissions are defined according to The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).\n\n1.2 The scope of GHG emissions includes the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).\n\n1.3 The entity shall specifically discuss its strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 GHG emissions that originate from perfluorinated compounds.\n\n2 The entity shall discuss its emission reduction target(s) and analyze its performance against the target(s), including the following, where relevant:"}
