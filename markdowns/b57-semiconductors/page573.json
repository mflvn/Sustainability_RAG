Semiconductor machinery and device manufacturers can reduce the environmental and human health impacts of their products by increasing the energy-efficiency of equipment and chips and reducing the amount of harmful materials in products. As consumer demand grows for energy-efficient devices that enable a longer battery life, reduce heat output, and allow end users to lower energy bills, semiconductor manufacturers that meet this need can gain a competitive advantage, driving revenues and market share growth. Companies can also benefit from working to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of toxic materials from chips destined for consumer devices, which has implications for the end-of-life management of electronic waste, an issue of growing legislative importance in many countries.\n\n## Metrics\n\nTC-SC-410a.1. Percentage of products by revenue that contain IEC 62474 declarable substances\n\n1 The entity shall disclose percentage of its products sold during the reporting period that contain declarable substances.\n\n1.1 A product is considered to contain a declarable substance if, according to International Electrotechnical Commission's IEC 62474 \u2013 Material Declaration for Products of and for the Electrotechnical Industry, the product contains an amount of the declarable substance that is:\n\n1.1.1 Above the \"reporting threshold\"\n\n1.1.2 Within the scope of the \"reporting application\" identified\n\n1.1.3 Within mandatory \"reporting requirement\"\n\n1.2 The entity shall calculate the percentage as the revenue from electrical, electronic, and related technology products sold that contain a declarable substance(s) divided by total revenue from electrical, electronic, and related technology products sold.\n\n2 The scope of disclosure includes all electrical, electronic, and related technology products, including products from a company not required to declare, or otherwise making declarations, according to IEC 62474.\n\nNote to TC-SC-410a.1\n\n1 The entity shall describe its approach to managing the use of substances that appear as declarable substance groups or declarable substances in IEC 62474, including a discussion of specific operational processes during which use of these substances is considered as well as a discussion of actions the entity has taken to manage the use of these substances."}
