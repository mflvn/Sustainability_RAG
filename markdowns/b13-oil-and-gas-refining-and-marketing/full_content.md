# Industry Description

Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing (R&M) companies refine petroleum products, market oil and gas products, and/ or operate gas stations and convenience stores, all of which comprise the downstream operations of the oil and gas value chain. The types of refinery products and crude oil inputs influence the complexity of the refining process used, with different expenditure needs and intensity of environmental and social impacts.

Note: The standards discussed below are for "pure-play" R&M activities, or independent R&M companies. Integrated oil and gas companies conduct upstream operations and are also involved in the distribution and/or refining or marketing of products. SASB has separate standards for the Oil and Gas Exploration & Production (EM-EP), and Midstream (EM-MD) industries. As such, integrated companies should also consider the disclosure topics and metrics from these standards.

15 Note to EM-RM-000.A – The total volume of crude oil and other feedstocks processed in the refinery system during the reporting period.

| Refining operating capacity ¹⁶ | Quantitative | Million barrels per calendar day (MBPD) | EM-RM-000.B |

¹⁶ Note to EM-RM-000.B – Operating (or operable) capacity is: the amount of capacity that, at the beginning of the period, is in operation; not in operation and not under active repair, but capable of being placed in operation within 30 days; or not in operation but under active repair that can be completed within 90 days. Operable capacity is the sum of the operating and idle capacity and is measured in barrels per calendar day.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Oil and Gas R&M operations generate significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, from a variety of sources. Emissions primarily consist of carbon dioxide and methane from the stationary combustion of fossil fuels for energy consumption. Energy costs are a significant share of refinery operating costs. Greenhouse gases are also released from process emissions, fugitive emissions resulting from leaks, emissions from venting and flaring, and from non-routine events such as equipment maintenance. The energy intensity of production, and therefore the GHG emissions intensity, can vary significantly depending on the type of crude oil feedstock used and refined product specifications. Companies that cost-effectively reduce GHG emissions from their operations can create operational efficiencies. Such reduction can also mitigate the impact on value of increased fuel costs from regulations that seek to limit—or put a put a price on—GHG emissions.

## Metrics

EM-RM-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations

1 The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol—carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃).

   1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO₂-e), calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP factors is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).

   1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.

2 Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).

   2.1 These emissions include direct emissions of GHGs from stationary or mobile sources; these sources include but are not limited to: equipment at well sites, production facilities, refineries, chemical plants, terminals, fixed site drilling rigs, office buildings, marine vessels transporting products, tank truck fleets, mobile drilling rigs, and moveable equipment at drilling and production facilities.

3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as the total amount of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions (CO2-e) that are covered under emissions-limiting regulations divided by the total amount of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions (CO2-e).

#### Page 118

3.2.1 For emissions that are subject to multiple emissions-limiting regulations, the entity shall not account for those emissions more than once.

3.3 The scope of emissions-limiting regulations excludes emissions covered under voluntary emissions-limiting regulations (e.g., voluntary trading systems), as well as disclosure-based regulations.

4 The entity may discuss any change in its emissions from the previous reporting period, including whether the change was due to emissions reductions, divestment, acquisition, mergers, changes in output, and/or changes in calculation methodology.

5 In the case that current reporting of GHG emissions to the CDP or other entity (e.g., a national regulatory disclosure program) differs in terms of the scope and consolidation approach used, the entity may disclose those emissions. However, primary disclosure shall be according to the guidelines described above.

6 The entity may discuss the calculation methodology for its emissions disclosure, such as if data are from continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS), engineering calculations, or mass balance calculations.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Refineries can use relatively large quantities of water depending on their size and the complexity of the refining process. This exposes them to the risk of reduced water availability, depending on their location, and related costs. Extraction of water from water-stressed regions or water contamination may also create tensions with local communities. Refinery operations often require wastewater treatment and disposal, often via on-site wastewater treatment plants before discharge. Reducing water use and contamination through recycling and other water management strategies may result in operational efficiencies for companies and lower their operating costs. They could also minimize the impacts of regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions on operations.

## Metrics

EM-RM-140a.1. (1) Total fresh water withdrawn, (2) percentage recycled, (3) percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

1. The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from freshwater sources:

   1.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local statutes and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no regulatory definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1000 parts per million of dissolved solids.

   1.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.

2. The entity shall disclose the percentage of water recycled as the volume, in thousands of cubic meters, recycled divided by the volume of water withdrawn.

   2.1 Any volume of water reused multiple times shall be counted as recycled each time it is recycled and reused.

3. The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40-80%) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.

4. The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn.

5. The entity shall disclose its water consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water consumed.

# Product Specifications & Clean Fuel Blends

## Topic Summary

Human health risks and broad environmental risks such as those associated with climate change have raised concerns about the end use of products such as gasoline from the Refining & Marketing (R&M) industry. In response, some regulatory jurisdictions have implemented product specifications and renewable fuel blends, which pose significant compliance and operational risks for R&M companies. Companies may face long-term reductions in revenue from fossil fuel-based products and services due to GHG mitigation policies such as the renewable fuel mandates or standards, as well as competition from non-fossil fuel products. Companies that purchase credits known as renewable identification numbers (RINs) to meet regulatory requirements for renewable fuels in the U.S. can face regulatory and cost risks. In order to ensure regulatory compliance and position themselves for long-term competitiveness, some companies are investing in or purchasing ethanol and other renewable biofuels. Advanced biofuels and fuel technologies have lower lifecycle impacts than traditional biofuels, and can be used to minimize future regulatory risks and public pressure. Although short-term costs to find commercially viable technologies can be significant, investments in R&D for such technologies could serve to advance R&M companies' long-term profitability.

## Metrics

EM-RM-410a.2. Total addressable market and share of market for advanced biofuels and associated infrastructure

1    The entity shall provide an estimation of the total addressable market for advanced biofuels and associated infrastructure.

1.1    Total addressable market is defined as potential revenue should the entity capture 100 percent of the market share of the product category (e.g., the global market for advanced biofuels and advanced biofuel infrastructure).

2    The entity shall disclose the share of the total addressable market for advanced biofuels and/or associated infrastructure that it currently captures with its products.

2.1    Market share shall be calculated as revenues from these products divided by the size of the total addressable market.

3    Advanced biofuels are defined as biofuels other than ethanol derived from corn starch (kernels) and having 50% lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions relative to gasoline.

4    Revenue from advanced biofuel infrastructure includes that from the entity's retail operations (i.e., fuel stations), joint ventures with primary producers, or technologies that enable the production of advanced biofuels.

5    If there is a significant difference between the total addressable market and the market that the entity can serve through its existing or planned capabilities, sales channels, or products (i.e., the serviceable available market) then the entity may disclose this information.

#### Page 123

6 The entity may provide a projection of growth of this market, where the projected addressable market is represented—based on a reasonable set of assumptions about changes in market conditions— as a percentage of year-on-year growth or as an estimate of the market size after a defined period (i.e., the market size in 10 years).

6.1 The entity may disclose its target three-year market share as a measurement of targeted growth, where the target is the percentage of the total addressable market that the entity plans to address over a three-year time horizon.

7 The entity may discuss other non-revenue generating initiatives it has undertaken to commercialize biofuels, such as partnerships (e.g., pilot projects, research and development projects) with fleet operators (air, ground, or marine transportation), airlines, vehicle manufacturers, and governmental agencies.
