Emissions primarily consist of carbon dioxide and methane from the stationary combustion of fossil fuels for energy consumption. Energy costs are a significant share of refinery operating costs. Greenhouse gases are also released from process emissions, fugitive emissions resulting from leaks, emissions from venting and flaring, and from non-routine events such as equipment maintenance. The energy intensity of production, and therefore the GHG emissions intensity, can vary significantly depending on the type of crude oil feedstock used and refined product specifications. Companies that cost-effectively reduce GHG emissions from their operations can create operational efficiencies. Such reduction can also mitigate the impact on value of increased fuel costs from regulations that seek to limit\u2014or put a put a price on\u2014GHG emissions.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-RM-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations\n\n1 The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083).\n\n   1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO\u2082-e), calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP factors is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).\n\n   1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.\n\n2 Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).\n\n   2.1 These emissions include direct emissions of GHGs from stationary or mobile sources; these sources include but are not limited to: equipment at well sites, production facilities, refineries, chemical plants, terminals, fixed site drilling rigs, office buildings, marine vessels transporting products, tank truck fleets, mobile drilling rigs, and moveable equipment at drilling and production facilities."}
