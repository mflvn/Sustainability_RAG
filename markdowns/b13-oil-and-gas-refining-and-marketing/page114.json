{"page_number": 114, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nOil & Gas - Refining & Marketing (R&M) companies refine petroleum products, market oil and gas products, and/ or operate gas stations and convenience stores, all of which comprise the downstream operations of the oil and gas value chain. The types of refinery products and crude oil inputs influence the complexity of the refining process used, with different expenditure needs and intensity of environmental and social impacts.\n\nNote: The standards discussed below are for \"pure-play\" R&M activities, or independent R&M companies. Integrated oil and gas companies conduct upstream operations and are also involved in the distribution and/or refining or marketing of products. SASB has separate standards for the Oil and Gas Exploration & Production (EM-EP), and Midstream (EM-MD) industries. As such, integrated companies should also consider the disclosure topics and metrics from these standards.\n\n15 Note to EM-RM-000.A \u2013 The total volume of crude oil and other feedstocks processed in the refinery system during the reporting period."}
