{"page_number": 121, "text_content": "# Water Management\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nRefineries can use relatively large quantities of water depending on their size and the complexity of the refining process. This exposes them to the risk of reduced water availability, depending on their location, and related costs. Extraction of water from water-stressed regions or water contamination may also create tensions with local communities. Refinery operations often require wastewater treatment and disposal, often via on-site wastewater treatment plants before discharge. Reducing water use and contamination through recycling and other water management strategies may result in operational efficiencies for companies and lower their operating costs. They could also minimize the impacts of regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions on operations.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-RM-140a.1. (1) Total fresh water withdrawn, (2) percentage recycled, (3) percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1. The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from freshwater sources:\n\n   1.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local statutes and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no regulatory definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n   1.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n2. The entity shall disclose the percentage of water recycled as the volume, in thousands of cubic meters, recycled divided by the volume of water withdrawn.\n\n   2.1 Any volume of water reused multiple times shall be counted as recycled each time it is recycled and reused.\n\n3. The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40-80%) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.\n\n4. The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn.\n\n5. The entity shall disclose its water consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water consumed."}
