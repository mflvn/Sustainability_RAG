{"page_number": 122, "text_content": "# Product Specifications & Clean Fuel Blends\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nHuman health risks and broad environmental risks such as those associated with climate change have raised concerns about the end use of products such as gasoline from the Refining & Marketing (R&M) industry. In response, some regulatory jurisdictions have implemented product specifications and renewable fuel blends, which pose significant compliance and operational risks for R&M companies. Companies may face long-term reductions in revenue from fossil fuel-based products and services due to GHG mitigation policies such as the renewable fuel mandates or standards, as well as competition from non-fossil fuel products. Companies that purchase credits known as renewable identification numbers (RINs) to meet regulatory requirements for renewable fuels in the U.S. can face regulatory and cost risks. In order to ensure regulatory compliance and position themselves for long-term competitiveness, some companies are investing in or purchasing ethanol and other renewable biofuels. Advanced biofuels and fuel technologies have lower lifecycle impacts than traditional biofuels, and can be used to minimize future regulatory risks and public pressure. Although short-term costs to find commercially viable technologies can be significant, investments in R&D for such technologies could serve to advance R&M companies' long-term profitability.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-RM-410a.2. Total addressable market and share of market for advanced biofuels and associated infrastructure\n\n1    The entity shall provide an estimation of the total addressable market for advanced biofuels and associated infrastructure.\n\n1.1    Total addressable market is defined as potential revenue should the entity capture 100 percent of the market share of the product category (e.g., the global market for advanced biofuels and advanced biofuel infrastructure).\n\n2    The entity shall disclose the share of the total addressable market for advanced biofuels and/or associated infrastructure that it currently captures with its products.\n\n2.1    Market share shall be calculated as revenues from these products divided by the size of the total addressable market.\n\n3    Advanced biofuels are defined as biofuels other than ethanol derived from corn starch (kernels) and having 50% lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions relative to gasoline.\n\n4    Revenue from advanced biofuel infrastructure includes that from the entity's retail operations (i.e., fuel stations), joint ventures with primary producers, or technologies that enable the production of advanced biofuels.\n\n5    If there is a significant difference between the total addressable market and the market that the entity can serve through its existing or planned capabilities, sales channels, or products (i.e., the serviceable available market) then the entity may disclose this information."}
