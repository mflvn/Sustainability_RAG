{"page_number": 119, "text_content": "2.5 The mechanism(s) for achieving the target; and\n\n2.6 Any circumstances in which the target or base year emissions have been, or may be, recalculated retrospectively or the target or base year has been reset which may include, but are not limited to energy efficiency efforts, energy source diversification, carbon capture and storage, or the implementation of leak detection and repair processes.\n\n3 The entity shall discuss activities and investments required to achieve the plans and/or targets, and any risks or limiting factors that might affect achievement of the plans and/or targets.\n\n4 The entity shall discuss the scope of its strategies, plans, and/or reduction targets, such as whether they pertain differently to different business units, geographies, or emissions sources.\n\n4.1 Categories of emissions sources may include:\n\n4.1.1 Flared hydrocarbons, including all emissions emitted from flares and which are associated with the management and disposal of unrecoverable natural gas via combustion of hydrocarbon products from routine operations, upsets, or emergencies\n\n4.1.2 Other combusted emissions, including, but not limited to: (1) emissions from stationary devices, including, but not limited to boilers, heaters, furnaces, reciprocating internal combustion engines and turbines, incinerators, and thermal/catalytic oxidizers, (2) emissions from mobile sources, including, but not limited to barges, ships, railcars, and trucks for material transport; planes/ helicopters and other company vehicles for personnel transport; forklifts, all terrain vehicles, construction equipment, and other off-road mobile equipment, and (3) other combusted emissions\n\n4.1.3 Process emissions, including, but not limited to those emissions that are not combusted and are intentional or designed into the process or technology to occur during normal operations and are a result of some form of chemical transformation or processing step. Such emissions include, but are not limited to those from hydrogen plants, amine units, glycol dehydrators, fluid catalytic cracking unit and reformer generation, and flexi-coker coke burn\n\n4.1.4 Vented emissions, including those emissions that are not combusted and are intentional or designed into the process or technology to occur during normal operations, and which include, but are not limited to: (1) venting from crude oil, condensate, or natural gas product storage tanks, gas-driven pneumatic devices, gas samplers, chemical injection pumps, exploratory drilling, loading/ballasting/transit, and loading racks, (2) venting resulting from maintenance/turn-arounds, including, but not limited to decoking of furnace tubes, well unloading, vessel and gas"}
