{"page_number": 582, "text_content": "# Managing Systemic Risks from Technology Disruptions\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nWith trends toward increased cloud computing and use of Software as a Service (SaaS), software and IT service providers need to ensure they have robust infrastructure and policies in place to minimize disruptions to their services. Disruptions such as programming errors or server downtime have the potential to generate systemic risks, as computing and data storage functions move from individual company servers in various industries to data centers of cloud-computing service providers. The risks are heightened particularly if the affected customers are in sensitive sectors, such as financial institutions or utilities, which are considered critical national infrastructure. Companies' investments in improving the reliability and quality of their IT infrastructure and services are likely to affect their ability to attract and retain customers, thereby impacting revenues and opportunities in new markets.\n\n## Metrics\n\nTC-SI-550a.1. Number of (1) performance issues and (2) service disruptions; (3) total customer downtime\n\n1    The entity shall disclose (1) the number of performance issues in software and information technology (IT) services provided to customers.\n\n     1.1    Performance issues are defined as any planned or unplanned downtime causing an interruption, of more than 10 minutes but less than or equal to 30 minutes, in the provision of cloud-based services to customers.\n\n     1.2    Performance issues include, but are not limited to, those caused by technical failures, programming errors, cyber attacks, weather events, or natural disasters at hosting facilities.\n\n2    The entity shall disclose (2) the number of service disruptions in software and IT services provided to customers.\n\n     2.1    Service disruptions are defined as any planned or unplanned downtime causing an interruption of more than 30 minutes in provision of cloud-based services to customers.\n\n     2.2    Service disruptions include, but are not limited to, those caused by technical failures, programming errors, cyber attacks, weather events, or natural disasters at hosting facilities.\n\n3    The entity shall disclose (3) the total customer downtime related to performance issues and service disruptions in software and IT services provided to customers.\n\n     3.1    Total customer downtime is defined as the interruption duration of each service disruption multiplied by the number of software and IT services licenses affected, reported in license-days. For context, the entity shall indicate the licensing basis (e.g., number of seats, number of CPU cores, number of cloud subscriptions) and whether the licenses are consumption-based or capacity based.\n\nNote to TC-SI-550a.1"}
