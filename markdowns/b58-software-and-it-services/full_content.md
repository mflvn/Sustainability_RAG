# Environmental Footprint of Hardware Infrastructure

## Topic Summary

With the growth of cloud-based service offerings, companies in this industry own, operate, or rent increasingly more data centers and other hardware; thus, managing the energy and water use associated with IT hardware infrastructure is important to shareholder value. Data centers need to be powered continuously, and disruptions to the energy supply can have a material impact on operations, depending on the magnitude and timing of the disruption. Companies face a tradeoff between energy and water consumption due to data center cooling needs; cooling data centers with water instead of chillers is a means of improving energy efficiency, but it can lead to dependence on significant local water resources. Decisions about data center specifications are important for managing costs, obtaining a reliable supply of energy and water, and lowering reputational risks, particularly as there is an increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and as opportunities arise from innovations in energy efficiency and renewable energy.

# Managing Systemic Risks from Technology Disruptions

## Topic Summary

With trends toward increased cloud computing and use of Software as a Service (SaaS), software and IT service providers need to ensure they have robust infrastructure and policies in place to minimize disruptions to their services. Disruptions such as programming errors or server downtime have the potential to generate systemic risks, as computing and data storage functions move from individual company servers in various industries to data centers of cloud-computing service providers. The risks are heightened particularly if the affected customers are in sensitive sectors, such as financial institutions or utilities, which are considered critical national infrastructure. Companies' investments in improving the reliability and quality of their IT infrastructure and services are likely to affect their ability to attract and retain customers, thereby impacting revenues and opportunities in new markets.
