# IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Health Care Distributors

Industry: Health care distributors purchase, inventory, and sell pharmaceutical products and medical equipment to hospitals, pharmacies, and physicians. Demand for the industry's services is driven largely by rates of insurance, pharmaceutical spending, illness, and demographics. The health care sector continues to face an emphasis on reduced costs and improved efficiencies, which will also impact the Health Care Distributors industry. Companies in this industry face challenges from consolidation and partnerships between pharmacies, payers, and manufacturers.

# Fleet Fuel Management

## Topic Summary

The distribution of health care products and supplies requires significant transportation networks. Concern over climate change and dwindling natural resources may impact fuel pricing, and expose health care distributors to fluctuations in costs. Firms that are able to improve transportation efficiencies may be able to enhance shareholder value.

## Metrics

### HC-DI-110a.1. Payload fuel economy

1 The entity shall disclose its aggregate payload fuel economy for its transportation fleet.

2 The entity shall calculate payload fuel economy across its delivery fleet, limited to vehicles used for the delivery of products (excluding vehicles used primarily for the transportation of passengers).

2.1 The entity shall disclose payload fuel economy for vehicles it operates (e.g., owns or long-term leases) and specify if all or a portion of its logistics operations are outsourced.

3 Payload fuel economy shall be calculated as: total gallons of fuel consumed / revenue tons miles (RTM), where revenue ton miles (RTM) = total weight of paid tonnage transported (payload) Ã— total distance in miles goods were transported.

3.1 Payload includes the weight of paid tonnage and excludes the vehicle weight.

4 The entity shall aggregate payload fuel economy for types of transportation, which include, but are not limited to:

4.1 Air transportation

4.2 Marine transportation

4.3 Rail transportation

4.4 Road transportation

### HC-DI-110a.2. Description of efforts to reduce the environmental impact of logistics

1 The entity shall describe the nature, scope, and implementation of its programs and initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of its logistics operations.

2 Relevant efforts to describe include, but are not limited to, upgrades to fleet (fuel efficiency), usage of alternative and/or renewable fuels, optimized logistics routes, and idling reduction programs.
