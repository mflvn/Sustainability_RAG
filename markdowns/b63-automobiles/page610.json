{"text_content": "# Fuel Economy & Use-phase Emissions\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nThe combustion of petroleum-based fuels by motor vehicles accounts for a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to global climate change. It also generates local air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter (PM), which can threaten human health and the environment. In this context, vehicle emissions are increasingly of concern to consumers and regulators around the world. While use-phase emissions are downstream from auto manufacturers, regulations often focus on auto manufacturers to help reduce these emissions, such as through fuel economy standards. More stringent emissions standards and changing consumer demands are driving the expansion of markets for electric vehicles and hybrids, as well as for conventional vehicles with high fuel efficiency. Moreover, manufacturers are innovating by designing vehicles made with lighter-weight materials to improve fuel efficiency. Companies that can meet current fuel-efficiency and emissions standards and continue to innovate to meet or exceed future regulatory standards in different markets are likely to strengthen their competitive position and expand their market share, while mitigating the risk of reduced demand for conventional vehicles.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### TR-AU-410a.1. Sales-weighted average passenger fleet fuel economy, by region\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the average fuel economy of its passenger and light-duty vehicle fleet, weighted for the footprint of vehicles sold, by geographic region.\n\n1.1 The average fuel economy shall be calculated by model year as required for regulatory purposes.\n\n1.2 In the absence of regulatory guidance on calculating a fleet average, the entity shall calculate performance based on the fuel economy of vehicles sold during the reporting period weighted by sales volume.\n\n1.3 The calculation shall be made on a fleet-average basis regardless of whether regulations are based on vehicle weight.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose the percentage by geographic region.\n\n2.1 Geographic regions are defined as the regions for which the entity conducts segment financial reporting and which are subject to fleet fuel economy, fuel consumption, or emissions standards.\n\n3 Disclosure may be provided in different units for each geographic region, including, but not limited to:\n\n3.1 Grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer (gCO2 / km) for (1) passenger cars and (2) light commercial vehicles sold in the European Union\n\n3.2 Liters of petrol per kilometer (L / km) for passenger vehicles sold in Japan\n", "page_number": 610}
