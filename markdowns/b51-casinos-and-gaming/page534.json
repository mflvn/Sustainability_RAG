{"page_number": 534, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nPublicly held casinos and gaming companies operate gambling facilities and/or platforms, including brick-and-mortar casinos, riverboat casinos, online gambling websites, and racetracks. The industry is characterized by high levels of regulatory oversight, which represents the main barrier to entry for new operators. Industry regulation varies significantly worldwide.\n\nNote: Select companies in the Casinos & Gaming industry are also engaged in activities of the Hotels & Lodging and/or Restaurants industries. The SASB Standards for such activities are outlined in the Hotels & Lodging and Restaurants standards. For the purposes of this standard, it is assumed that casinos and gaming companies are engaged solely in operating gambling facilities and providing online gaming services, and therefore issues such as water management and food safety, which may be material for companies that have significant hotel and restaurant operations, are not covered by this industry standard.\n\n90 Note to SV-CA-000.C \u2013 The number of active customers shall be considered as the number for which there was at least one financial transaction (bet, deposit, withdraw) with real currency within the reporting period, where real currency is defined by the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network."}
