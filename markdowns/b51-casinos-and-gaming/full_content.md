## Table 2. Activity Metrics

| ACTIVITY METRIC | CATEGORY | UNIT OF MEASURE | CODE |
|-----------------|----------|------------------|------|
| Number of tables | Quantitative | Number | SV-CA-000.A |
| Number of slots | Quantitative | Number | SV-CA-000.B |

# Industry Description

Publicly held casinos and gaming companies operate gambling facilities and/or platforms, including brick-and-mortar casinos, riverboat casinos, online gambling websites, and racetracks. The industry is characterized by high levels of regulatory oversight, which represents the main barrier to entry for new operators. Industry regulation varies significantly worldwide.

Note: Select companies in the Casinos & Gaming industry are also engaged in activities of the Hotels & Lodging and/or Restaurants industries. The SASB Standards for such activities are outlined in the Hotels & Lodging and Restaurants standards. For the purposes of this standard, it is assumed that casinos and gaming companies are engaged solely in operating gambling facilities and providing online gaming services, and therefore issues such as water management and food safety, which may be material for companies that have significant hotel and restaurant operations, are not covered by this industry standard.

90 Note to SV-CA-000.C – The number of active customers shall be considered as the number for which there was at least one financial transaction (bet, deposit, withdraw) with real currency within the reporting period, where real currency is defined by the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

With many facilities open 24 hours a day, the Casinos & Gaming industry requires a large amount of energy to operate. Casino facilities often have few windows and therefore rely on their buildings' mechanical systems for heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (HVAC), and lighting. Fossil fuel-based energy production and consumption contribute to significant environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution, and have the potential to impact casino companies' results of operations. It is becoming increasingly important for companies that rely on electricity consumption for their operations to manage energy efficiency as well as energy availability, including the risks and opportunities associated with energy sourcing from fossil fuels and/or from renewable and alternative energy sources.

## Metrics

SV-CA-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable

1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.

2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3.3    The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity
consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable
energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power
purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy
certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy
Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that
explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs
are paired with grid electricity.

3.3.1  For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs
must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf
of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable
energy.

3.3.2  For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement
must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained
or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order
for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.3  The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of
the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of
renewable energy.

3.4    For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from
biomass sources is limited to the following:

3.4.2  Energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a
third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable
Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest
Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered
eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for
Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional
standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state
renewable portfolio standard.

4      The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under
this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and
conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data including electricity
from solar or wind energy).
