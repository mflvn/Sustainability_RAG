The fuel consumption of vehicle fleets is a significant industry expense, both in terms of operating costs and associated capital expenditures. Fossil fuel consumption can contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. These environmental impacts have the potential to affect waste management companies through regulatory exposure and the competitiveness of new contract proposals. Hedging fuel purchases is a common tool used to manage fleet-fuel risks; however, more and more waste management companies are upgrading to more fuel-efficient fleets or switching to natural gas vehicles. A cleaner-burning fleet may also be seen as more favorable by communities living near waste management facilities with heavy traffic.\n\n## Metrics\n\nIF-WM-110b.1. (1) Fleet fuel consumed, (2) percentage natural gas, (3) percentage renewable\n\n1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of fuel consumed by its fleet vehicles as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n1.1 The calculation methodology for fuel consumed shall be based on actual fuel consumed as opposed to design parameters.\n\n1.2 Acceptable calculation methodologies for fuel consumed include, but are not limited to, methodologies based on:\n\n1.2.1 Adding fuel purchases made during the reporting period to beginning inventory at the start of the reporting period, less any fuel inventory at the end of the reporting period\n\n1.2.2 Tracking fuel consumed by vehicle\n\n1.2.3 Tracking fuel expenses\n\n2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of fuel consumed that is natural gas.\n\n2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as the amount of natural gas consumed (in GJ) divided by the total amount of fuel consumed (in GJ).\n\n3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of fuel consumed that was renewable fuel.\n\n3.1 Renewable fuel is generally defined as fuel that meets all of the following requirements:\n\n3.1.1 Produced from renewable biomass;\n\n3.1.2 Used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel present in a transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel; and"}
