{"page_number": 401, "text_content": "3.3    The scope of emissions-limiting regulations excludes emissions covered under voluntary emissions-limiting regulations (e.g., voluntary trading systems), as well as reporting-based regulations.\n\n4    The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of its gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions that are covered under emissions reporting-based regulations.\n\n4.1    Emissions reporting-based regulations are defined as regulations that demand the disclosure of GHG emissions data to regulators and/or the public, but for which there is no limit, cost, target, or controls on the amount of emissions generated.\n\n4.2    The percentage shall be calculated as the total amount of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions (CO2-e) that are covered under emissions reporting-based regulations divided by the total amount of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions (CO2-e).\n\n4.2.1    For emissions that are subject to multiple emissions reporting-based regulations, the entity shall not account for those emissions more than once.\n\n4.3    The scope of emissions reporting-based regulations does not exclude emissions covered under emissions-limiting regulations.\n\n5    The entity may discuss any change in its emissions from the previous reporting period, including whether the change was due to emissions reductions, divestment, acquisition, mergers, changes in output, and/or changes in calculation methodology.\n\n6    In the case that current reporting of GHG emissions to the CDP or other entity (e.g., a national regulatory disclosure program) differs in terms of the scope and consolidation approach used, the entity may disclose those emissions. However, primary disclosure shall be according to the guidelines described above.\n\n7    The entity may discuss the calculation methodology for its emissions disclosure, such as if data are from continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS), engineering calculations, or mass balance calculations.\n\nIF-WM-110a.2. (1) Total landfill gas generated, (2) percentage flared, (3) percentage used for energy\n\n1    The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount, in millions of British Thermal Units (MMBtu), of landfill gas generated from its owned or operated facilities.\n\n1.1    Landfill gas is defined as gas produced as a result of anaerobic decomposition of waste materials in the landfill.\n\n2    The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of landfill gas that was flared.\n\n2.1    The percentage shall be calculated as the amount (in MMBtu) of landfill gas that was flared divided by the total amount (in MMBtu) of landfill gas generated."}
