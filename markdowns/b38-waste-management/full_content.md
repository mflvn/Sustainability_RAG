# Industry Description

The Waste Management industry includes companies that collect, store, dispose of, recycle, or treat various forms of waste from residential, commercial, and industrial clients. Types of waste include municipal solid waste, hazardous waste, recyclable materials, and compostable or organic materials. Major companies are commonly vertically integrated, providing a range of services from waste collection to landfilling and recycling, while others provide specialized services such as treating medical and industrial wastes. Waste-to-energy operations are a distinct industry segment. Certain industry players also provide environmental engineering and consulting services, mostly to large industrial clients.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Landfill gas is a significant anthropogenic contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because it contains highly potent methane. As a result, landfill gas is frequently required to be limited by regulators. These emissions can be reduced through a variety of control technologies that require significant capital expenditures: landfill gas collection efficiency improvements, control devices, and increased methane oxidization. Methane collected through capture systems can be combusted in a flare, an engine, or a turbine to dramatically reduce the overall toxicity and potency of raw emissions. Landfill gas capture is particularly important for owners and operators of large landfills that have been the target of regulation. Companies that operate in the waste-to-energy segment of the industry are able to lower lifecycle emissions of waste through decreased future emissions from landfills and displaced energy generation, but face increased Scope 1 emissions from the operation of waste-to-energy facilities. Overall, GHG emissions pose regulatory risks for the industry, with potential impacts on operational costs and capital expenditures. There is also the potential for revenue generation through the sale of natural gas and energy from waste-to-energy facilities, as well as the ability to lower fuel purchases by using processed landfill gas to power operations. Performance on this issue can affect a company's ability to secure new permits and/or renew existing ones, which can impact revenue.

# Fleet Fuel Management

## Topic Summary

Many companies in the Waste Management industry own and operate large vehicle fleets for waste collection and transfer. The fuel consumption of vehicle fleets is a significant industry expense, both in terms of operating costs and associated capital expenditures. Fossil fuel consumption can contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. These environmental impacts have the potential to affect waste management companies through regulatory exposure and the competitiveness of new contract proposals. Hedging fuel purchases is a common tool used to manage fleet-fuel risks; however, more and more waste management companies are upgrading to more fuel-efficient fleets or switching to natural gas vehicles. A cleaner-burning fleet may also be seen as more favorable by communities living near waste management facilities with heavy traffic.

## Metrics

IF-WM-110b.1. (1) Fleet fuel consumed, (2) percentage natural gas, (3) percentage renewable

1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of fuel consumed by its fleet vehicles as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

1.1 The calculation methodology for fuel consumed shall be based on actual fuel consumed as opposed to design parameters.

1.2 Acceptable calculation methodologies for fuel consumed include, but are not limited to, methodologies based on:

1.2.1 Adding fuel purchases made during the reporting period to beginning inventory at the start of the reporting period, less any fuel inventory at the end of the reporting period

1.2.2 Tracking fuel consumed by vehicle

1.2.3 Tracking fuel expenses

2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of fuel consumed that is natural gas.

2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as the amount of natural gas consumed (in GJ) divided by the total amount of fuel consumed (in GJ).

3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of fuel consumed that was renewable fuel.

3.1 Renewable fuel is generally defined as fuel that meets all of the following requirements:

3.1.1 Produced from renewable biomass;

3.1.2 Used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel present in a transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel; and

#### Page 406

3.1.3 Achieved net Has lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction on a life cycle basis.

3.2 The entity shall disclose the standard or regulation used to determine if a fuel is renewable.

3.3 The percentage shall be calculated as the amount of renewable fuel consumed (in GJ) divided by the total amount of fuel consumed (in GJ).

4 The scope of disclosure is limited to fuel consumed by vehicles owned or operated by the entity.

5 In calculating energy consumption from fuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

6 The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage.

## IF-WM-110b.2. Percentage of alternative fuel vehicles in fleet

1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of its fleet vehicles that are alternative fuel vehicles.

1.1 Alternative fuel vehicles are defined as vehicles powered by biodiesel, denatured alcohol, electricity, hydrogen, methanol, mixtures containing up to 85 percent methanol or denatured ethanol, natural gas, or propane (liquefied petroleum gas). Alternative energy vehicles also include any vehicle achieving a significant reduction in petroleum consumption, advanced lean burn technology vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, and hybrid electric vehicles.

1.2 The percentage shall be calculated as the number of alternative energy vehicles in its fleet divided by the total number of vehicles in its fleet.
