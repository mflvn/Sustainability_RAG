Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 and lifecycle emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets\n\n1 The entity shall discuss its long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage its Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\n1.1 Scope 1 emissions are defined according to The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).\n\n1.2 The scope of GHG emissions includes the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).\n\n2 The entity shall discuss how lifecycle GHG emissions factor into its management of Scope 1 emissions and overall business strategy.\n\n2.1 Relevant aspects to discuss include, but are not limited to:\n\n2.1.1 The trade-offs between lifecycle emissions and Scope 1 emissions\n\n2.1.2 How such trade-offs are evaluated within the context of the entity's business strategy and operational areas of focus (e.g., landfill gas management, waste-to-energy, recycling, composting)\n\n2.1.3 The extent to which the trade-offs factor into the entity's business strategy, including identified areas of opportunity for growth and its capital expenditure strategy"}
