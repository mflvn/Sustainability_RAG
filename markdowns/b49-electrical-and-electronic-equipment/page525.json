Regulations are incentivizing companies to reduce or eliminate the use of harmful chemicals in their products. To a lesser extent, regulations and customers are driving companies to lower the environmental footprint of their products in the use phase, primarily in terms of energy intensity. Electrical and electronic equipment companies that develop cost-effective products and solutions for energy efficiency can benefit from increased revenues and market share, stronger competitive positioning, and enhanced brand value. Similarly, products with reduced chemical safety concerns can provide opportunities for increased market share.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### RT-EE-410a.1. Percentage of products by revenue that contain IEC 62474 declarable substances\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of products sold during the reporting period that contain IEC 62474 declarable substances.\n\n1.1 A product contains a declarable substance if, according to International Electrotechnical Commission's IEC 62474 \u2013 Material Declaration for Products of and for the Electrotechnical Industry, it contains an amount of the substance above the \"reporting threshold,\" is within the scope of the \"reporting application\" identified, and for which the \"reporting requirement\" is mandatory, according to IEC 62474.\n\n1.2 The entity shall calculate the percentage as the revenue from products sold that contain a declarable substance(s) divided by total revenue from products sold.\n\n2 The scope of disclosure includes all products, including products from an entity not required to declare, or otherwise make declarations, according to IEC 62474.\n\nNote to RT-EE-410a.1\n\n1 The entity shall discuss its approach to managing its use of substances listed as declarable substance groups or declarable substances in IEC 62474, including a discussion of specific operational processes during which use of these substances is considered and a discussion of actions the entity has taken to manage the use of these substances.\n\n2 Relevant management approaches and actions to describe include, but are not limited to:\n\n2.1 Product design criteria for the exclusion of substances (e.g., banned substances lists)\n\n2.2 Use of material substitution assessments, materials and parts procurement guidelines, product safety testing, product declarations (e.g., material safety data sheets), and product labeling"}
