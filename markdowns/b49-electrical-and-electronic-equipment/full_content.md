# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Electrical and electronic equipment companies may use significant amounts of energy. Purchased electricity represents the largest share of energy expenditures in the industry, followed by purchased fuels. The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and energy management strategies depends on the type of products manufactured. A company's energy mix, including the use of electricity generated on-site, grid-sourced electricity, and the use of alternative energy, can play an important role in lowering the cost and increasing the reliability of energy supply, and ultimately affect the company's cost structure and exposure to regulatory shifts.

## Metrics

RT-EE-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable

1. The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

   1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

   1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

   1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2. The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.

   2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3. The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

   3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

   3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

#### Page 524

3.3    The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity
       consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable
       energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power
       purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy
       certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs); a Green-e Energy
       Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that
       explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs
       are paired with grid electricity.

       3.3.1   For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs
               must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf
               of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable
               energy.

       3.3.2   For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement
               must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained
               or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order
               for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

       3.3.3   The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of
               the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of
               renewable energy.

3.4    For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from
       hydro and biomass sources is limited to the following:

       3.4.2   Energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a
               third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable
               Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest
               Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered
               eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for
               Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional
               standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state
               renewable portfolio standard.

4      The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under
       this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and
       conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data including electricity
       from solar or wind energy).

# Product Lifecycle Management

## Topic Summary

Electrical and electronic equipment companies face increasing challenges and opportunities associated with environmental and social externalities that stem from the use of their products. Regulations are incentivizing companies to reduce or eliminate the use of harmful chemicals in their products. To a lesser extent, regulations and customers are driving companies to lower the environmental footprint of their products in the use phase, primarily in terms of energy intensity. Electrical and electronic equipment companies that develop cost-effective products and solutions for energy efficiency can benefit from increased revenues and market share, stronger competitive positioning, and enhanced brand value. Similarly, products with reduced chemical safety concerns can provide opportunities for increased market share.

## Metrics
