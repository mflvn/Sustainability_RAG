{"page_number": 527, "text_content": "2.2 Examples of products and systems include, but are not limited to, turbine controllers, relays, switchgears, solar PV fuses, SCADA systems, interconnection technologies, and other balance of plant equipment designed for renewable energy applications.\n\n2.3 The scope of products and systems is limited to those that enable the integration of renewable energy into established energy infrastructure and grids; it excludes revenue from the sale and/or installation of renewable energy generation hardware such as wind turbines, solar photovoltaic modules, and solar thermal electricity generation equipment.\n\n3 A product shall be considered to have been designed to increase energy efficiency if documentation shows that the entity has tested, modeled, or otherwise established an increase in energy efficiency during the product's use phase.\n\n3.1 Examples of products that increase energy efficiency include, but are not limited to: smart grid technologies and infrastructure (e.g., demand response systems, distribution automation, smart inverters, or advanced metering equipment); smart home and intelligent building control products; flexible alternating current transmission systems; and low-loss transformers.\n\n3.1.1 Smart grid is defined as a modernization of the electricity delivery systems so as to monitor, protect, and automatically optimize the operation of its interconnected elements\u2014from the central and distributed generation through the transmission network and the distribution system, to industrial users and building automation systems, and to energy storage installations and to end-use consumers.\n\n3.2 The scope of disclosure includes products that impart an incremental improvement to energy efficiency, insofar as the entity can demonstrate that the improvement is meaningful, such as through alignment with the milestones set forth in Section 5, \"Key Sectors\" of the European Commission's Road Map to a Resource Efficient Europe and/or with EU Directive 2012/27/EU, and/or through conformance with energy efficiency standards such as the International Electrotechnical Commission's (IEC) IE2 High Efficiency, IE3 Premium Efficiency, and IE4 Super Premium Efficiency.\n\n3.3 The scope of disclosure excludes products that impart improved resource efficiency in an ancillary, indirect, or minimal way (e.g., a conventional product that is slightly lighter than the previous generation of the product)."}
