{"page_number": 219, "text_content": "2.3 Acceptable calculation methodologies include those that conform to the GHG Protocol as the base reference, but provide additional guidance, such as industry- or region-specific guidance. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n2.3.1 GHG Reporting Guidance for the Aerospace Industry published by International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG)\n\n2.3.2 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidance: Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n\n2.3.3 India GHG Inventory Program\n\n2.3.4 ISO 14064-1\n\n2.3.5 Petroleum Industry Guidelines for reporting GHG emissions, 2nd edition, 2011, published by IPIECA.\n\n2.3.6 Protocol for the quantification of greenhouse gas emissions from waste management activities published by Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EpE)\n\n2.4 GHG emissions data shall be consolidated and disclosed according to the approach with which the entity consolidates its financial reporting data, which is generally aligned with the \"financial control\" approach defined by the GHG Protocol, and the approach published by the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) described in REQ-07, \"Organisational boundary,\" of the CDSB Framework for reporting environmental information, natural capital and associated business impacts (April 2018).\n\n3 The entity may discuss any change in its emissions from the previous reporting period, including whether the change was due to emissions reductions, divestment, acquisition, mergers, changes in output, and/or changes in calculation methodology.\n\n4 In the case that current reporting of GHG emissions to the CDP or other entity (e.g., a national regulatory disclosure program) differs in terms of the scope and consolidation approach used, the entity may disclose those emissions. However, primary disclosure shall be according to the guidelines described above.\n\n5 The entity may discuss the calculation methodology for its emissions disclosure, such as if data are from continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS), engineering calculations, or mass balance calculations.\n\nFB-FR-110b.2. Percentage of refrigerants consumed with zero ozone-depleting potential\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of the refrigerants consumed in its operations that have zero ozone-depleting potential (ODP).\n\n1.1 ODP is defined as the amount of ozone depletion caused by a substance, where ozone depletion is defined as a chemical destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer beyond natural reactions."}
