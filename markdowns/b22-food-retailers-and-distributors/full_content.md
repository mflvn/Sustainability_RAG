# Fleet Fuel Management

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Food Retailers & Distributors industry own and operate vehicle fleets to deliver products between its distribution and retail locations. The fuel consumption of vehicle fleets is a significant industry expense, both in terms of operating costs and associated capital expenditures. Fossil fuel consumption can contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. These environmental impacts have the potential to affect food retailers and distributors through regulatory exposure. Efficiencies gained in fuel use can reduce costs, mitigate exposure to fossil fuel price volatility, and limit the carbon footprint associated with storage and transportation. Short-term capital expenditures in fuel-efficient fleets and more energy efficient technologies may be outweighed by long-term operational savings and decreased exposure to regulatory risks.

## Metrics

### FB-FR-110a.1. Fleet fuel consumed, percentage renewable

1.1    The calculation methodology for fuel consumed shall be based on actual fuel consumed as opposed to design parameters.

1.2    Acceptable calculation methodologies for fuel consumed include, but are not limited to, methodologies based on:

1.2.1    Adding fuel purchases made during the reporting period to beginning inventory at the start of the reporting period, less any fuel inventory at the end of the reporting period

1.2.2    Tracking fuel consumed by vehicles

1.2.3    Tracking fuel expenses

2    The entity shall disclose the percentage of the total amount of fuel consumed by its fleet vehicles that is renewable fuel.

2.1    Renewable fuel is generally defined as fuel that meets all of the following requirements:

2.1.1    Produced from renewable biomass;

2.1.2    Used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel present in a transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel; and

2.1.3    Achieved net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction on a life cycle basis.

2.2    The entity shall disclose the standard or regulation used to determine if a fuel is renewable.

# Air Emissions from Refrigeration

## Topic Summary

Emissions of refrigeration chemicals from equipment used to store and display perishable foods pose unique regulatory risks for the Food Retailers & Distributors industry. International regulations on hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) aim to mitigate damage by HCFCs to the Earth's ozone layer. Additionally, many common HCFCs and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are highly potent greenhouse gases (GHGs), which increases the industry's exposure to climate change-related regulations. Regulators can assess penalties to companies that violate emissions standards, while companies may be required to upgrade or replace equipment, requiring capital expenditures, to reduce their emissions or replace existing refrigerants with potentially costlier, but less environmentally-damaging alternatives.

## Metrics

### FB-FR-110b.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions from refrigerants

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Food retail and distribution facilities are typically more energy-intensive than other types of commercial spaces. Energy is used predominately for refrigeration, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), as well as lighting. Companies in the industry generally purchase the majority of consumed electricity, while some are beginning to generate energy on-site or add renewable energy into their energy mix. Energy production and consumption contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution, which have the potential to indirectly, yet materially, impact the operations of food retailers and distributors. Companies that manage their overall energy use through increased efficiency and use of alternative energy sources can increase profitability by lowering expenses and reducing risk.

# Management of Environmental & Social Impacts in the Supply Chain

## Topic Summary

Food retailers and distributors source merchandise from a wide range of manufacturers. These suppliers face a myriad of sustainability-related challenges that include resource conservation, water scarcity, animal welfare, fair labor practices, and climate change. When poorly managed, these issues can affect the price and availability of food. Additionally, consumers are increasingly concerned with the production methods, origins, and externalities associated with the foods they purchase, which may affect a company's reputation. Food retailers and distributors can also work with suppliers on packaging design to generate cost savings in transport, improve brand reputation, and reduce the environmental impact. Companies that can address product supply risks by assessing and engaging with suppliers, implementing sustainable sourcing guidelines, and enhancing supply chain transparency will likely be better positioned to improve supply chain resiliency, mitigate reputational risks, and potentially increase consumer demand or capture new market opportunities.
