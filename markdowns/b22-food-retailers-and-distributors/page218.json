{"text_content": "# Air Emissions from Refrigeration\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nEmissions of refrigeration chemicals from equipment used to store and display perishable foods pose unique regulatory risks for the Food Retailers & Distributors industry. International regulations on hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) aim to mitigate damage by HCFCs to the Earth's ozone layer. Additionally, many common HCFCs and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are highly potent greenhouse gases (GHGs), which increases the industry's exposure to climate change-related regulations. Regulators can assess penalties to companies that violate emissions standards, while companies may be required to upgrade or replace equipment, requiring capital expenditures, to reduce their emissions or replace existing refrigerants with potentially costlier, but less environmentally-damaging alternatives.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### FB-FR-110b.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions from refrigerants\n\n1. The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083)\u2014 that originated from the use of refrigerants.\n\n   1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO\u2082-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).\n\n   1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.\n\n   1.3 Refrigerants are defined as substances or mixtures used in a heat pump or refrigeration cycle for the purpose of absorbing and releasing heat.\n\n2. Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).\n\n   2.1 The scope of emissions includes all direct emissions of GHGs resulting from the entity's use of commercial stationary and mobile refrigerants in retail locations, distribution centers, and its transportation fleet.\n\n   2.2 For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of emissions excludes direct emissions of GHGs from the combustion of fossil fuels, non-refrigerant process emissions, and other sources unrelated to refrigerants.", "page_number": 218}
