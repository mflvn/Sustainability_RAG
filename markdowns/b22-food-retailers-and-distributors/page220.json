{"page_number": 220, "text_content": "1.2    A refrigerant with zero ODP is defined as substance that has a published ODP value of zero, has no impact on the stratospheric ozone layer beyond natural reactions, and does not contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), halons, methyl bromide, carbon tetrachloride, hydrobromofluorocarbons, chlorobromomethane, or methyl chloroform.\n\n2    A list of compounds recognized as ozone-depleting substances (ODS), and their respective ODPs, under the Montreal Protocol, is available through the United Nations website, \"Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.\"\n\n2.1    Consumption of refrigerants is defined as the amount of refrigerant charged into the entity's commercial refrigeration equipment during the reporting period.\n\n2.2    The percentage shall be calculated as the amount (by weight) of refrigerants consumed in the entity's operations that have zero ODP, divided by the total amount (by weight) of refrigerants consumed in the entity's operations.\n\n3    The scope of disclosure includes all commercial stationary and mobile refrigerants used by the entity in retail locations, distribution centers, and transportation fleet.\n\nFB-FR-110b.3. Average refrigerant emissions rate\n\n1    The entity shall disclose its average refrigerant emissions rate as a percentage.\n\n1.1    Refrigerant emissions rate is defined as the rate of refrigerant loss from a commercial refrigeration equipment or system.\n\n1.2    The entity shall calculate the average refrigerant emissions rate as the total amount, in pounds, of refrigerant emitted over the reporting period, divided by the total weight, in pounds, of refrigerants that are charged into commercial refrigeration equipment over the reporting period.\n\n2    The scope of disclosure includes all commercial stationary and mobile refrigerant sources used by the entity in its retail locations, distribution centers, and its transportation fleet."}
