{"page_number": 216, "text_content": "# Fleet Fuel Management\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nCompanies in the Food Retailers & Distributors industry own and operate vehicle fleets to deliver products between its distribution and retail locations. The fuel consumption of vehicle fleets is a significant industry expense, both in terms of operating costs and associated capital expenditures. Fossil fuel consumption can contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. These environmental impacts have the potential to affect food retailers and distributors through regulatory exposure. Efficiencies gained in fuel use can reduce costs, mitigate exposure to fossil fuel price volatility, and limit the carbon footprint associated with storage and transportation. Short-term capital expenditures in fuel-efficient fleets and more energy efficient technologies may be outweighed by long-term operational savings and decreased exposure to regulatory risks.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### FB-FR-110a.1. Fleet fuel consumed, percentage renewable\n\n1    The entity shall disclose the total amount of fuel consumed by its fleet vehicles as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n1.1    The calculation methodology for fuel consumed shall be based on actual fuel consumed as opposed to design parameters.\n\n1.2    Acceptable calculation methodologies for fuel consumed include, but are not limited to, methodologies based on:\n\n1.2.1    Adding fuel purchases made during the reporting period to beginning inventory at the start of the reporting period, less any fuel inventory at the end of the reporting period\n\n1.2.2    Tracking fuel consumed by vehicles\n\n1.2.3    Tracking fuel expenses\n\n2    The entity shall disclose the percentage of the total amount of fuel consumed by its fleet vehicles that is renewable fuel.\n\n2.1    Renewable fuel is generally defined as fuel that meets all of the following requirements:\n\n2.1.1    Produced from renewable biomass;\n\n2.1.2    Used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel present in a transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel; and\n\n2.1.3    Achieved net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction on a life cycle basis.\n\n2.2    The entity shall disclose the standard or regulation used to determine if a fuel is renewable."}
