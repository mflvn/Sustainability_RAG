{"page_number": 149, "text_content": "# Transition Risk Exposure\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nCommercial banks' loans to and investments in carbon-related industries are becoming inherently and increasingly risky due to evolving regulation and rapid technological change related to the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient global economy. Heightened risk may emerge for entities in carbon-related industries from the premature write-downs, or potential 'stranding,' of long-lived assets. Borrowers or investees may also face further financial pressure from increased costs of operations and compliance due to climate-related risks. Calculating and disclosing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of counterparties and investees attributed to the loans and investments made by a commercial bank\u2014i.e., the bank's 'financed emissions'\u2014can therefore help users of the general purpose financial reporting of commercial banks better understand their exposure to such risks. Commercial banks that fail to manage these transition risks and associated opportunities through their lending and investing could face diminished returns and reduced value for investors.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFN-CB-1. (1) Gross exposure to carbon-related industries, by industry, (2) total gross exposure to all industries, and (3) percentage of total gross exposure for each carbon-related industry\n\n1. The entity shall disclose its gross exposure to carbon-related industries, by industry.\n\n   1.1 For funded amounts, gross exposure is defined as the funded carrying amounts expressed in the presentation currency of the entity's financial statements whether prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards or other GAAP.\n\n      1.1.1 Carrying amount means the amount before subtracting the loss allowance, when applicable.\n\n   1.2 For undrawn loan commitments, gross exposure is defined as the full amount of the commitment expressed in the presentation currency of the entity's financial statements.\n\n   1.3 For derivatives, gross exposure is defined as the contractual amounts to be exchanged in a derivative for which gross cash flows are exchanged, or the net amounts in a derivative for which net cash flows are exchanged, as applicable, expressed in the presentation currency of the entity's financial statements.\n\n   1.4 Carbon-related industries are industries responsible for relatively high direct or indirect GHG emissions.\n\n      1.4.1 Carbon related industries include but are not limited to:\n      \n      - Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels\n      - Chemicals, Construction Materials, Metals & Mining, and Paper & Forest Products"}
