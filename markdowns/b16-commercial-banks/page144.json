{"page_number": 144, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nCommercial banks accept deposits and make loans to individuals and corporations as well as engage in lending for infrastructure, real estate, and other projects. By providing these services, the industry serves an essential role in the functioning of global economies and in facilitating the transfer of financial resources to their most productive capacity. The industry is driven by the volume of deposits, quality of loans made, the economic environment, and interest rates. It is further characterized by risk from mismatched assets and liabilities. The regulatory environment that governs the commercial banking industry saw significant changes in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and continues to evolve today. These and other regulatory trends have the potential to impact shareholder value and sustainability performance. Commercial banks with global operations must manage new regulations in multiple jurisdictions that are creating regulatory uncertainty, particularly around consistent application of new rules.\n\nNote: The SASB Commercial Banks (FN-CB) Standard addresses \"pure play\" commercial banking services, which the SASB recognizes may not include all the activities of integrated financial institutions, such as investment banking and brokerage services, mortgage finance, consumer finance, asset management and custody services, and insurance. Separate SASB accounting standards are available that address the sustainability issues for activities in those industries."}
