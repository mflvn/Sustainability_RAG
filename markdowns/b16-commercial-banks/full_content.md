# Industry Description

Commercial banks accept deposits and make loans to individuals and corporations as well as engage in lending for infrastructure, real estate, and other projects. By providing these services, the industry serves an essential role in the functioning of global economies and in facilitating the transfer of financial resources to their most productive capacity. The industry is driven by the volume of deposits, quality of loans made, the economic environment, and interest rates. It is further characterized by risk from mismatched assets and liabilities. The regulatory environment that governs the commercial banking industry saw significant changes in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and continues to evolve today. These and other regulatory trends have the potential to impact shareholder value and sustainability performance. Commercial banks with global operations must manage new regulations in multiple jurisdictions that are creating regulatory uncertainty, particularly around consistent application of new rules.

Note: The SASB Commercial Banks (FN-CB) Standard addresses "pure play" commercial banking services, which the SASB recognizes may not include all the activities of integrated financial institutions, such as investment banking and brokerage services, mortgage finance, consumer finance, asset management and custody services, and insurance. Separate SASB accounting standards are available that address the sustainability issues for activities in those industries.

# Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Credit Analysis

## Topic Summary

As financial intermediaries, commercial banks contribute to significant positive and negative environmental and social externalities through their lending practices. Therefore, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors can have material implications for the underlying companies, assets, and projects that commercial banks lend to across a range of industries. It is therefore increasingly necessary for companies to examine ESG factors when determining the quality of collateral. Commercial banks also have the potential to enable positive environmental and social externalities and to generate significant revenue streams through their lending practices. Commercial banks that fail to address these risks and opportunities could face diminished returns and reduced value for shareholders. Commercial banks should subsequently disclose how ESG factors are integrated into lending processes and the current level of portfolio risk associated with specific sustainability trends. In particular, investor and regulatory pressure is mounting for banks to disclose how they address climate change related risks.

# Transition Risk Exposure

## Topic Summary

Commercial banks' loans to and investments in carbon-related industries are becoming inherently and increasingly risky due to evolving regulation and rapid technological change related to the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient global economy. Heightened risk may emerge for entities in carbon-related industries from the premature write-downs, or potential 'stranding,' of long-lived assets. Borrowers or investees may also face further financial pressure from increased costs of operations and compliance due to climate-related risks. Calculating and disclosing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of counterparties and investees attributed to the loans and investments made by a commercial bank—i.e., the bank's 'financed emissions'—can therefore help users of the general purpose financial reporting of commercial banks better understand their exposure to such risks. Commercial banks that fail to manage these transition risks and associated opportunities through their lending and investing could face diminished returns and reduced value for investors.
