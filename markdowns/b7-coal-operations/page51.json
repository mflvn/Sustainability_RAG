Estimated carbon dioxide emissions embedded in proven coal reserves\n\n1    The entity shall calculate and disclose an estimate of the carbon dioxide emissions embedded in its proven coal reserves.\n\n1.1    Nota bene \u2014 this estimate applies a factor for potential CO2 only and does not include an estimate for all potential greenhouse gas emissions, as these are dependent on downstream use (e.g., utility electricity generation, industrial heating and electricity generation, cement production, or steel production).\n\n2    Estimated potential carbon dioxide emissions from proven coal reserves shall be calculated according to the following formula, derived from Meinshausen et al:\n\n2.1    E = R \u00d7 V \u00d7 C, where:\n\n2.1.1    E are the potential emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide (kg CO2);\n\n2.1.2    R are the proven reserves in gigagrams (Gg);\n\n2.1.3    V is the net calorific value in terajoules per gigagram (TJ/Gg); and\n\n2.1.4    C is the effective carbon dioxide emission factor in kilograms CO2 per terajoule (kg/TJ).\n\n3    In the absence of data specific to the entity's coal reserves, carbon content shall be calculated using default data for each major type of coal resource published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.", "page_number": 51}
