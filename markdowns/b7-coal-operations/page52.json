{"page_number": 52, "text_content": "3.1    The entity shall use default carbon content values per unit of energy that is listed in IPCC Table 1.3 Default Values of Carbon Content, Volume 2: Energy, Chapter 1.\n\n3.2    The entity shall use calorific values per weight of coal resource contained in IPCC Table 1.2 Default Net Calorific Values (NCVs) and Lower and Upper Limit of the 95% Confidence Intervals, Volume 2: Energy, Chapter 1.\n\n4    The entity shall use engineering estimates to determine the weight of its coal reserves in gigagrams.\n\n5    For other assumptions required to estimate the carbon content of coal reserves, the entity shall rely on guidance from the IPCC, Greenhouse Gas Protocol, U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA), or the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nEM-CO-420a.3. Discussion of how price and demand for coal and/or climate regulation influence the capital expenditure strategy for exploration, acquisition, and development of assets\n\n1    The entity shall discuss how projections for price and demand for coal and the path of air quality and climate regulation influence the entity's capital expenditure (CAPEX) strategy.\n\n1.1    This discussion should include the entity's projections and assumptions about future coal prices and the likelihood that certain price and demand scenarios occur.\n\n2    The entity shall discuss the implications of price and demand scenario planning (i.e., EM-CO-420a.1) and how they may affect decisions to explore, acquire, and develop new reserves.\n\n3    The entity may discuss factors that materially influence its CAPEX decision making, including, but not limited to:\n\n3.1    How the scope of air quality and climate change regulation\u2014such as which countries, regions, and/or industries are likely to be impacted\u2014may influence where the entity focuses its exploration and development\n\n3.2    Its view of the alignment between the time horizon during which price and demand for coal may be affected by climate regulation and time horizons for returns on capital expenditures on reserves\n\n3.3    How the structure of climate regulation\u2014i.e., a carbon tax versus cap-and-trade\u2014may differently affect price and demand, and thus the entity's capital expenditure decision making\n\n4    The entity may discuss how these trends affect decision-making in the context of different types of reserve expenditures, including development of assets, acquisition of properties with proven reserves, acquisition of properties with unproven resources, and exploration activities."}
