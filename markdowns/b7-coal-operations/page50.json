The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.\n\n5 ~~The entity shall follow guidance published by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its Oil and Gas Reporting Modernization (Section \u00a7229.1202 (Item 1202) Disclosure of Reserves) for conducting a reserves sensitivity analysis.~~\n\n3 The entity shall conduct a reserves sensitivity analysis and disclose, in the aggregate, an estimate of reserves estimated for each product type based on different price and cost criteria, such as a range of prices and costs that may reasonably be achieved, including standardized futures prices or management's own forecasts.\n\n4 The entity shall also disclose the price and cost schedules and assumptions on which disclosed values are based.\n\n5 6 The entity may summarize its findings in the following table format:\n\nTable 1.
