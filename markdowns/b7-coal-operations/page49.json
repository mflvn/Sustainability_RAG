{"page_number": 49, "text_content": "# Reserves Valuation & Capital Expenditures\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nEstimates suggest that coal companies may be unable to extract a significant proportion of their coal reserves if greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are to be controlled to limit global temperature increases to two degrees Celsius per the Paris Agreement. Stewardship of capital resources while taking into account medium- to long-term trends, particularly related to climate change mitigation actions, is critical in order to prevent asset impairment and maintain profitability and creditworthiness. Globally, regulations and policies are and may continue to be put into place to limit GHG emissions from coal-fired power plants\u2014the customers of coal companies\u2014thus lowering the demand for, and subsequently the prices of, coal. Coal demand is also being affected by regulations governing other harmful air emissions that apply to coal-fired power plants. An expansion of GHG-mitigation regulations may increase the magnitude of potential financial impacts in the medium to long term. Along with improved competitiveness of alternative energy technologies, this poses a long-term risk for the reserves and capital expenditures of coal operations companies.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-CO-420a.1. Sensitivity of coal reserve levels to future price projection scenarios that account for a price on carbon emissions\n\n1    The entity shall perform a sensitivity analysis of its reserves to determine how several future scenarios may affect its determination of whether the reserves are proven or probable.\n\n2    The entity shall analyze the sensitivity of its current proven and probable reserves using the price trajectories published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its World Energy Outlook (WEO) publication, including:\n\n2.1    Current Policies Scenario, which assumes no changes in policies from the mid-point of the year of publication of the WEO.\n\n2.2    New Policies Scenario, which assumes that broad policy commitments and plans that have been announced by countries\u2014including national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and plans to phase out fossil-energy subsidies\u2014occur, even if the measures to implement these commitments have yet to be identified or announced. This broadly serves as the IEA baseline scenario.\n\n2.3    Sustainable Development Scenario, which assumes an energy pathway occurs that is consistent with the goal of limiting the global increase in temperature to 2\u00b0C 1.5\u00b0C by limiting concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\n2.4    The entity shall consider the WEO scenarios as a normative reference, thus any updates to the WEO made year-on-year shall be considered updates to this guidance."}
