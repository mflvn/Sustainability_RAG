Coal operations are water intensive. The use of water in coal washing to remove sulfur, in cooling drilling equipment, and in transporting coal in slurry pipelines can impact resources. The severity of these risks can vary depending on the region's water availability and the regulatory environment. Reducing water use and contamination could also create operational efficiencies for companies and lower their operating costs. Wastewater treatment and discharge is often regulated by national or local agencies. Violating limits on selenium, sulfate, and dissolved solids could affect coal operations companies through significant penalties, compliance costs, delays in production, or higher costs related to mine closure.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-CO-140a.1. (1) Total fresh water withdrawn, (2) percentage recycled, (3) percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from freshwater sources:\n\n1.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local statutes and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no regulatory definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n1.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose the percentage of water recycled as the volume, in thousands of cubic meters, recycled divided by the volume of water withdrawn.\n\n2.1 Any volume of water reused multiple times shall be counted as recycled each time it is recycled and reused.\n\n3 The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40-80%) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.\n\n4 The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn.\n\n5 The entity shall disclose its water consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water consumed.\n\nEM-CO-140a.2. Number of incidents of non-compliance associated with water quality permits, standards, and regulations\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the total number of instances of non-compliance, including violations of a technology-based standard and exceedances of quantity and/or quality-based standards."}
