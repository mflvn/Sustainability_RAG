{"page_number": 490, "text_content": "# Fuel Economy & Emissions in Use-phase\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nCustomer preferences and regulatory drivers are increasing the demand for energy-efficient and reduced-emissions products in the Aerospace & Defense industry. Many of the industry's products are powered by fossil fuels and release greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other air emissions during use. As the designers and manufacturers of most of the global aerospace and defense transportation fleet, companies in this industry have a unique opportunity to support many industries and government agencies that are striving to meet GHG emissions and fuel-management goals and imperatives. Products with higher fuel economy and lower use-phase emissions may be well positioned to capture expanding market share and adapt to changing customer preferences and regulations around fuel economy and emissions.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### RT-AE-410a.1. Revenue from alternative energy-related products\n\n1 The entity shall disclose its total revenue from the sale of alternative energy-related products, where:\n\n1.1 Alternative energy-related products include products such as vehicles, vehicle components, and stationary power generation equipment that rely on alternative fuel or energy as a primary means of propulsion and/or energy production.\n\n1.2 Alternative energy and fuel includes:\n\n1.2.1 Renewable fuel and energy, which is defined as that from sources that are capable of being replenished in a short time through ecological cycles, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydroelectric, and biomass (including ethanol, first-generation biofuels, and advanced biofuels)\n\n1.2.2 Hydrogen fuel and fuel cells including those that operate using natural gas, propane, and methanol\n\n1.3 Electric, hybrid electric, and dual-fueled products for which one of the fuel sources is an alternative fuel shall be considered within the scope of disclosure.\n\n### RT-AE-410a.2. Description of approach and discussion of strategy to address fuel economy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of products\n\n1 The entity shall describe its approach and discuss its strategies for improving the fuel economy and reducing the use-phase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of its products.\n\n2 Relevant aspects of the approach and strategy include improvements to existing products and technologies, the introduction of new technologies, research and development efforts into advanced technologies, and partnerships with peers, academic institutions, and/or customers (including governmental customers)."}
