# Industry Description

Companies in the Aerospace & Defense industry include manufacturers of commercial aircraft, aircraft parts, aerospace and defense products, as well as defense prime contractors. Commercial aircraft manufacturers represent approximately one quarter of industry revenues and sell mainly to commercial airlines and governments. Aerospace and defense parts manufacturers represent the largest segment of the industry by total revenue, selling primarily to governments. Both aerospace and defense manufacturers operate globally and serve a global customer base. Defense primes represent approximately one quarter of total industry revenues and manufacture products including military aircraft, space vehicles, missile systems, ammunition, small arms, naval ships, and other commercial and military vehicles. Their customers consist of various government agencies and related businesses with global operations. The defense prime category also includes firearms manufacturers that sell to law enforcement agencies, businesses, distributors, retailers, and consumers. Key sustainability topics within the industry include the energy efficiency and emissions profile of products and management of manufacturing energy and waste.

82 Note to RT-AE-000.A â€“ Production should be disclosed as the number of units produced by product category, where relevant product categories include (1) ground vehicles, (2) aircraft, (3) marine vehicles, (4) vehicle and aircraft components, and (5) space and weapons systems.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Energy is a critical input to the manufacturing processes of aerospace and defense companies. Purchased electricity represents the largest share of energy expenditures in the industry, followed by purchased fuels. The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and energy management strategies depends on the type of products manufactured. A company's energy mix, including the use of electricity generated on-site, grid-sourced electricity, and the use of alternative energy, can play an important role in influencing the cost and reliability of energy supply, and ultimately affect the company's cost structure and regulatory risk.

## Metrics

RT-AE-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable

1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.

2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

#### Page 489

3.3 The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity.

3.3.1 For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.2 For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.3 The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of renewable energy.

3.4 For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from biomass sources is limited to the following:

3.4.2 Energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state renewable portfolio standard.

4 The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data including electricity from solar or wind energy).

# Fuel Economy & Emissions in Use-phase

## Topic Summary

Customer preferences and regulatory drivers are increasing the demand for energy-efficient and reduced-emissions products in the Aerospace & Defense industry. Many of the industry's products are powered by fossil fuels and release greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other air emissions during use. As the designers and manufacturers of most of the global aerospace and defense transportation fleet, companies in this industry have a unique opportunity to support many industries and government agencies that are striving to meet GHG emissions and fuel-management goals and imperatives. Products with higher fuel economy and lower use-phase emissions may be well positioned to capture expanding market share and adapt to changing customer preferences and regulations around fuel economy and emissions.

## Metrics

### RT-AE-410a.1. Revenue from alternative energy-related products

1 The entity shall disclose its total revenue from the sale of alternative energy-related products, where:

1.1 Alternative energy-related products include products such as vehicles, vehicle components, and stationary power generation equipment that rely on alternative fuel or energy as a primary means of propulsion and/or energy production.

1.2 Alternative energy and fuel includes:

1.2.1 Renewable fuel and energy, which is defined as that from sources that are capable of being replenished in a short time through ecological cycles, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydroelectric, and biomass (including ethanol, first-generation biofuels, and advanced biofuels)
