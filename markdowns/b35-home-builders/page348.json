{"page_number": 348, "text_content": "# Land Use & Ecological Impacts\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nHome builders face challenges directly related to the ecological impacts of development activities. Developments often take place on previously undeveloped land, and companies must manage the ecosystem disruption of construction activities as well as the regulations and permitting processes that accompany \"greenfield\" land development. Regardless of the siting decisions companies make, industry development activities generally carry risks related to land and water contamination, mismanagement of waste, and excessive strain on water resources during the construction and use phases. Violation of environmental regulations can result in costly fines and delays that decrease financial returns while potentially harming reputations. Companies with repeated violations or track records of prior activities with excessive ecological impacts may find it difficult to receive approval from local communities for new developments, thereby decreasing future revenue and market share. Companies that concentrate development efforts in water-stressed regions may see further challenges to permitting approvals, and also face risks related to land or home depreciation due to water shortage concerns. Environmental quality control procedures, \"smart growth\" strategies (including a focus on redevelopment sites), and conservation strategies may help ensure compliance with environmental laws, and therefore mitigate financial risks, while improving future growth opportunities.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-HB-160a.1. Number of (1) lots and (2) homes delivered on redevelopment sites\n\n1 The entity shall (1) disclose the number of controlled lots that are located on redevelopment sites.\n\n1.1 The scope of controlled lots includes all lots owned or contractually available for ownership through option contracts or other equivalent types of contracts.\n\n1.2 The scope of redevelopment sites shall include brownfield and greyfield sites, and shall include sites that meet national, state, or local designations for such terms. In the absence of national, state, or local definitions, the following definitions shall be used:\n\n1.2.1 Redevelopment sites are defined as sites that were previously developed, including the replacement, remodeling, or reuse of existing structures to accommodate new development.\n\n1.2.2 Brownfield sites are defined, as \"real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.\"\n\n1.2.3 Greyfield sites are defined, as, \"any site previously developed with at least 50% of the surface area covered with impervious material.\""}
