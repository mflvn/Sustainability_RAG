Companies in the Home Builders industry can improve the resource efficiency of homes over their lifecycle through sustainable design practices and choice of materials. Energy-saving products and techniques such as designing homes for efficient heating and cooling can help to reduce dependence on energy, whether it comes from the electric grid or onsite fuel combustion. These measures, which are intended to improve the resource efficiency of homes, can decrease the costs of home ownership through lower utility bills. Water saving features such as low-flow faucets alleviate strain on local communities, while likely also lowering costs. Homebuyer awareness of the importance of the energy and water efficiency creates a potential for companies to increase demand in their target market, thereby increasing revenue and/or margins. Effectively applying resource efficiency design principles in a cost-effective manner may serve as a competitive advantage, especially when companies are successful in systematically educating customers on the long-term benefits of these homes.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-HB-410a.1.
