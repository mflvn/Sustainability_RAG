{"page_number": 346, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Home Builders industry is comprised of companies that develop new homes and residential communities. Development efforts generally include the acquisition of land, site preparation, the construction of homes, and home sales. The majority of industry activity is focused on the development and sale of single-family homes, which are typically part of company-designed residential communities. A smaller segment is centered on townhomes, condominiums, multi-family housing, and mixed-use development. Many companies in the industry offer financing services to individual homebuyers. The industry is fragmented, as there is a large number of developers of all sizes, which vary in company structure and geographic focus. Listed companies tend to be significantly larger, and more integrated than the numerous privately held home builders.\n\n47 Note to IF-HB-160a.3 \u2013 The entity shall briefly describe the nature, context, and any corrective actions taken as a result of the monetary losses."}
