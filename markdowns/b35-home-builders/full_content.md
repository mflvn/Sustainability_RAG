# Industry Description

The Home Builders industry is comprised of companies that develop new homes and residential communities. Development efforts generally include the acquisition of land, site preparation, the construction of homes, and home sales. The majority of industry activity is focused on the development and sale of single-family homes, which are typically part of company-designed residential communities. A smaller segment is centered on townhomes, condominiums, multi-family housing, and mixed-use development. Many companies in the industry offer financing services to individual homebuyers. The industry is fragmented, as there is a large number of developers of all sizes, which vary in company structure and geographic focus. Listed companies tend to be significantly larger, and more integrated than the numerous privately held home builders.

# Land Use & Ecological Impacts

## Topic Summary

Home builders face challenges directly related to the ecological impacts of development activities. Developments often take place on previously undeveloped land, and companies must manage the ecosystem disruption of construction activities as well as the regulations and permitting processes that accompany "greenfield" land development. Regardless of the siting decisions companies make, industry development activities generally carry risks related to land and water contamination, mismanagement of waste, and excessive strain on water resources during the construction and use phases. Violation of environmental regulations can result in costly fines and delays that decrease financial returns while potentially harming reputations. Companies with repeated violations or track records of prior activities with excessive ecological impacts may find it difficult to receive approval from local communities for new developments, thereby decreasing future revenue and market share. Companies that concentrate development efforts in water-stressed regions may see further challenges to permitting approvals, and also face risks related to land or home depreciation due to water shortage concerns. Environmental quality control procedures, "smart growth" strategies (including a focus on redevelopment sites), and conservation strategies may help ensure compliance with environmental laws, and therefore mitigate financial risks, while improving future growth opportunities.

# Design for Resource Efficiency

## Topic Summary

Residential buildings, when occupied, consume significant amounts of energy and water. Companies in the Home Builders industry can improve the resource efficiency of homes over their lifecycle through sustainable design practices and choice of materials. Energy-saving products and techniques such as designing homes for efficient heating and cooling can help to reduce dependence on energy, whether it comes from the electric grid or onsite fuel combustion. These measures, which are intended to improve the resource efficiency of homes, can decrease the costs of home ownership through lower utility bills. Water saving features such as low-flow faucets alleviate strain on local communities, while likely also lowering costs. Homebuyer awareness of the importance of the energy and water efficiency creates a potential for companies to increase demand in their target market, thereby increasing revenue and/or margins. Effectively applying resource efficiency design principles in a cost-effective manner may serve as a competitive advantage, especially when companies are successful in systematically educating customers on the long-term benefits of these homes.

## Metrics

3. The entity may provide an analysis of such price increases relative to the cost of improvements in, and third-party certifications of, energy efficiency, water efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Analysis may additionally include target return rates compared to realized return rates of improvements.

# Climate Change Adaptation

## Topic Summary

The impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events and changing climate patterns, may impact the markets companies select to develop homes and residential communities. Companies with business models that incorporate ongoing assessments of climate change risks, and adapt to such risks, are likely to more effectively grow company value over the long term, partially through reductions in risk. More specifically, strategies focused on home development activities in floodplains and coastal regions that are exposed to extreme weather events, such as flooding, have increased needs for their business models to adapt to climate change, especially considering long-term challenges like flood insurance rates, the financial stability of government-subsidized flood insurance programs, permitting approvals, and financing stipulations. Rising climate risks and the increasing cost of occupying properties in volatile regions may translate into reduced long-term demand, land value depreciation, and concerns over understated long-term costs of home ownership. Additionally, companies that build developments in water-stressed regions risk losing land value and may face problems with permitting approvals. The active assessment of climate change risks and a holistic view of long-term homebuyer demand may enable companies to successfully adapt to such risks.
