{"page_number": 355, "text_content": "# Climate Change Adaptation\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nThe impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events and changing climate patterns, may impact the markets companies select to develop homes and residential communities. Companies with business models that incorporate ongoing assessments of climate change risks, and adapt to such risks, are likely to more effectively grow company value over the long term, partially through reductions in risk. More specifically, strategies focused on home development activities in floodplains and coastal regions that are exposed to extreme weather events, such as flooding, have increased needs for their business models to adapt to climate change, especially considering long-term challenges like flood insurance rates, the financial stability of government-subsidized flood insurance programs, permitting approvals, and financing stipulations. Rising climate risks and the increasing cost of occupying properties in volatile regions may translate into reduced long-term demand, land value depreciation, and concerns over understated long-term costs of home ownership. Additionally, companies that build developments in water-stressed regions risk losing land value and may face problems with permitting approvals. The active assessment of climate change risks and a holistic view of long-term homebuyer demand may enable companies to successfully adapt to such risks.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-HB-420a.1.
