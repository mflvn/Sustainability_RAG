Coupled with the potential spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, these events may present material implications for the Health Care Delivery industry. Company disclosure on policies, practices, and preparedness relating to climate change will help investors understand how value will be protected.\n\n## Metrics\n\nHC-DY-450a.1. Description of policies and practices to address: (1) the physical risks due to an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and (2) changes in the morbidity and mortality rates of illnesses and diseases, associated with climate change\n\n1. The entity shall describe the nature, scope, and implementation of its policies and practices related to addressing the risks to physical infrastructure and assets presented by changes in the frequency, severity, type, and geographic location of extreme weather events such as:\n\n   1.1 Risks to physical infrastructure that is located in flood prone low-lying and/or hurricane-prone areas\n\n   1.2 Risks to physical infrastructure based on facility design, such as having key medical equipment in basements or the availability of backup power\n\n2. The entity shall describe the nature, scope, and implementation of its policies and practices related to addressing the risks presented by the changes in prevalence, geography, and severity of certain diseases that are likely to be impacted by climate change, such as:\n\n   2.1 The need for added and/or flexible capacity due to influx of patients due to heat-related illness\n\n   2.2 Obtaining the necessary facilities and expertise to identify and treat changing disease profiles in patients, such as for:\n\n      2.2.1 Malaria, dengue fever, and other vector borne diseases that affect tropical populations, but due to climate change may target non-tropical regions in the future\n\n      2.2.2 Heat-related diseases (e.g., lung diseases such as asthma caused by increases in ground level ozone)\n\n      2.2.3 Waterborne diseases (e.g., cholera due to increased flooding incidence)\n\n      2.2.4 Human developmental disorders (e.g., malnutrition due to decreased food availability)"}
