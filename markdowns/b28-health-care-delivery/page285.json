Disposal fees for these types of waste are typically higher than that of conventional waste and can present a significant cost for the industry. Companies that are able to reduce the amount of waste generated by enhanced waste segregation strategies, recycling, and reuse can limit their exposure to these costs.\n\n## Metrics\n\nHC-DY-150a.1. Total amount of medical waste, percentage (a) incinerated, (b) recycled or treated, and (c) landfilled\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the total amount of medical waste generated, in metric tons, aggregated for all facilities it owns and operates.\n\n2 Medical waste (also known as regulated medical waste, infectious waste, biomedical waste, or biohazardous waste), that may be subject to jurisdictional regulation, includes:\n\n2.1 Cultures and Stocks \u2014 Cultures and stocks of infection agents and associated biological cultures, including cultures from medical and pathological laboratories, and stocks of infectious agents from research and industrial laboratories, waste from the production of biological, discarded live and attenuated vaccines, and culture dishes and devices used to transfer, inoculate, and mix cultures.\n\n2.2 Pathological Wastes \u2014 Human pathological wastes, including tissues, organs, body parts, and body fluids that are removed during surgery and autopsy, or other medical procedures, and specimens of body fluids and their containers.\n\n2.3 Human Blood and Blood Products \u2014 (1) Liquid waste human blood; (2) products of blood; (3) items saturated and/or dropping with human blood; or (4) items that were saturated and/or dripping with human blood that are now caked with dried human blood, including serum, plasma, and other blood components, and their containers that were used or intended for use in patient care, testing and laboratory analysis, or the development of pharmaceuticals. Intravenous bags are also included in this category.\n\n2.4 Sharps \u2014 Sharps that have been used in animal or human patient care or treatment, or in medical research or industrial laboratories, including hypodermic needles, syringes (with or without the attached needle), Pasteur pipettes, scalpel blades, blood vials, needles with attached tubing, and culture dishes (regardless of presence of infectious agents).
