# Industry Description

The Health Care Delivery industry owns and manages hospitals, clinics, and other health care-related facilities. Companies provide a range of services, including inpatient and outpatient care, surgery, mental health, rehabilitation, and clinical laboratory services. Demand for health care delivery services is driven largely by rates of insurance coverage, demographics, illness, and injury rates. The industry is characterized by high fixed labor and facilities costs, and an increased regulatory emphasis on reduced costs of care and improved outcomes. Health care delivery companies also face significant competition for patients and resources from private, nonprofit, and religious health care systems.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Health care delivery companies operate energy-intensive facilities and rely on both purchased electricity and fuel. The consumption of both can contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. Legislative attempts to limit these impacts and to incentivize energy efficiency and renewable energy may result in price volatility associated with fossil fuels and conventional electricity. Companies that are able to improve energy efficiency can decrease costs and limit exposure to fluctuations in energy pricing.
