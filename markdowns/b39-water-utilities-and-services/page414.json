{"page_number": 414, "text_content": "# End-Use Efficiency\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nWater efficiency and conservation at the consumer level, whether a product of government mandates, environmental consciousness, or demographic trends, is increasingly important for long-term resource availability and the financial performance of the water supply segment of the industry. The end-use efficiency topic addresses how utilities work with regulators to mitigate revenue declines in the context of the increasing need for resource efficiency. Water efficiency mechanisms, including rate decoupling, can ensure that a utility's revenue can adequately cover its fixed costs and provide the desired levels of returns regardless of sales volume, while simultaneously incentivizing customers to conserve water. Efficiency mechanisms can better align utilities' economic incentives with environmental and social interests, including resource efficiency, lower rates, and increased capital investments in infrastructure. Water utilities are able to manage their exposure to the impact of rate mechanisms through positive regulatory relations, forward-looking rate cases that incorporate efficiency, and a strong execution of efficiency strategy.\n\n## Metrics\n\nIF-WU-420a.1. Percentage of water utility revenues from rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of water utility revenues from rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience.\n\n1.1 The scope of rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience is limited to rate structures that are explicitly and intentionally designed to:\n\n1.1.1 Financially incentivize customers to reduce water consumption and/or improve water efficiency; and\n\n1.1.2 Improve the revenue resilience of the water utility, primarily in circumstances of declining average customer water use and/or improving average customer water efficiency.\n\n1.2 The scope of rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience includes, but is not limited to, revenue decoupled rate structures.\n\n1.2.1 Revenue decoupled rate structures are defined as a rate adjustment mechanism that separates the utility's fixed cost recovery from the volume sold\u2014and the utility's revenues are collected based on the regulatory determined revenue requirement.\n\n1.2.2 Revenue decoupled rate structures may also be referred to as, \"revenue regulation\" or \"revenue cap regulation,\" where the regulator establishes an allowed revenue requirement and adjusts collections so as to achieve that allowed, or 'target,' revenue irrespective of actual sales."}
