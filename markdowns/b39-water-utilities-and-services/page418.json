{"text_content": "# Water Supply Resilience\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nWater supply systems obtain water from groundwater and surface water sources. Water supplies may either be accessed directly or purchased from a third party, often a government entity. Water scarcity, water source contamination, infrastructure failures, regulatory restrictions, competing users, and overconsumption by customers are all factors that can jeopardize access to sufficient water supplies. These issues, combined with an increasing risk of extreme and frequent drought conditions due to climate change, may lead to inadequate supplies or mandated water restrictions. The related financial impacts may manifest in different ways, depending on rate structure, but are most likely to impact company value through decreased revenue. Water supply challenges may also lead to increases in the price of purchased water, which could result in higher operating costs. Failures of critical infrastructure such as aqueducts and canals, which could result from events such as earthquakes, are capable of presenting catastrophic risks to customers of the water supply system and could inflict untold financial consequences. Companies are able to mitigate water supply risks (and the resulting financial risks) through diversification of water supplies, sustainable withdrawal levels, technological and infrastructure improvements, contingency planning, positive relations with regulators and other major users, as well as rate structures.\n\n## Metrics\n\nIF-WU-440a.1. Total water sourced from regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress, percentage purchased from a third party\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of fresh water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was sourced from all sources in regions with High (40-80 percent) or Extremely High (>80 percent) Baseline Water Stress.\n\n1.1 Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, and lakes), groundwater, and wholesale water purchased from a third party.\n\n1.2 Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n1.3 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n1.4 High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress shall be classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose the percentage of fresh water sourced in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress that was purchased from a third party.", "page_number": 418}
