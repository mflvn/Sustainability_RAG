{"page_number": 420, "text_content": "1.1.1 Environmental constraints\u2014such as water resources in water-stressed regions, drought, interannual or seasonal variability, severe weather events, risks due to the impact of climate change, and any impacts or risks associated with contaminated sources\n\n1.1.2 Regulatory, infrastructure, and financial constraints\u2014such as reliance on key infrastructure to obtain water, risk of restrictions to obtaining sufficient water due to regulations or the entity's ability to obtain and retain water rights, permits, and allocations, and stakeholder perceptions and concerns related to water sources (e.g., those from local communities, non-governmental organizations, and regulatory agencies).\n\n1.1.3 How risks may vary by water source\u2014including surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater, or wholesale water supplies.\n\n2 The entity shall include a description of the potential impacts that these risks may have on its operations and the timeline over which such risks are expected to manifest.\n\n2.1 Impacts may include, but are not limited to, those associated with costs, revenues, liabilities, continuity of operations, access to water, and reputation.\n\n3 The entity shall provide a discussion of its short-term and long-term strategy or plans to manage these risks, including the following, where relevant:\n\n3.1 Diversification of water sources\n\n3.2 Contingency planning in the event of critical infrastructure failure\n\n3.3 The use of alternative, watershed-based approaches to align overall infrastructure decisions with overall watershed goals.\n\n3.4 The scope of its strategy, plans, or targets, such as whether they pertain differently to different business units (e.g., residential versus industrial), geographies, or regulatory frameworks (e.g., rate structures and/or mandated water-use restrictions)\n\n3.5 The activities and investments established to address water sourced from areas of water stress or scarcity and any risks or limiting factors that might affect the ability to address water scarcity\n\n3.6 The efforts to secure and retain reliable long-term water supplies through senior water rights, permits, and/or allocations, including the entity's ability to secure water (e.g., through purchase from a third party) should it not be able to retain sufficient allocations\n\n4 Disclosure of strategies, plans, and infrastructure investments shall be limited to activities that were ongoing (active) or reached completion during the reporting period."}
