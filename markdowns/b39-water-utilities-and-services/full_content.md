# Industry Description

Companies in the Water Utilities & Services industry own and operate water supply and wastewater treatment systems (generally structured as regulated utility businesses), or provide operational and other specialized water services to system owners (usually market-based operations). Water supply systems include the sourcing, treatment, and distribution of water to residences, businesses, and other entities such as governments. Wastewater systems collect and treat wastewater, including sewage, graywater, industrial waste fluids, and stormwater runoff, before discharging the resulting effluent back into the environment.

Note: The scope of the Water Utilities & Services industry (IF-WU) excludes water services that fall into the category of infrastructure design and development. These activities fall within the Engineering & Construction Services industry (IF-EC).

62. Note to IF-WU-140a.1 – The entity shall discuss the use of and challenges associated with planned and corrective maintenance in its distribution system.
63. Note to IF-WU-420a.2 – The entity shall discuss customer efficiency measures that are required by regulations for each of its relevant markets.

#### Page 408

64 Note to IF-WU-450a.3 – The entity shall discuss notable service disruptions such as those that affected a significant population or those of extended duration.

65 Note to IF-WU-000.A – The number of customers served shall be defined, consistent with the 2017 AWWA Utility Benchmarking Performance Management for Water and Wastewater, published by American Water Works Association, as the number of individual service agreements for water or wastewater services at single properties, where an individual may own more than one property and be counted as a customer more than once. The entity may disclose additional customer types if such customer types exist that do not fall within the scope of the customer types described above. Disclosure of the number of customers by customer type shall additionally be broken out by the number of customers (in each customer type) provided with water services, and separately, provided with wastewater services. The entity may additionally disclose the number of customers (in each customer type) by other types of services.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Water Utilities & Services industry require significant energy inputs for the withdrawal, conveyance, treatment, and distribution or discharge of potable water and wastewater. Utility operating costs are directly related to energy use, which is typically a company's largest operating cost after purchased water, chemicals, and labor. Purchased grid electricity is the most common energy input. In more remote locations, on-site generation is used to power equipment. The inefficient use of purchased grid electricity creates environmental externalities, such as Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Regulations that address environmental concerns are likely to affect the future grid energy mix, leading to increases in prices. Additionally, climate change is also expected to impact grid reliability, and affect the availability of water resources. As a result, the energy intensity of water utilities is likely to increase in the future as water sources become more difficult to access. Alternative water treatment, such as recycling and desalination, can also require more energy. Together with decisions about the use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site electricity generation, energy efficiency can play an important role in influencing both the cost and the reliability of the energy supply.

## Metrics

IF-WU-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable

1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.

2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

#### Page 410

3.1    Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

3.2    The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3.3    The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity.

# Distribution Network Efficiency

## Topic Summary

Water utilities develop, maintain, and operate complex interconnected infrastructure networks that include extensive pipelines, canals, reservoirs, and pump stations. Significant volumes of water are lost in the distribution network (called "non-revenue water," as it is a distributed volume of water that is not reflected in customer billings). This water is lost primarily because of infrastructure failures and inefficiencies, such as leaking pipes and service connections. Non-revenue real water losses may negatively impact financial performance, raise customer rates, and squander water and other resources such as energy and treatment chemicals. Conversely, improvements to infrastructure and operating processes can limit non-revenue losses, positively impacting revenues and possibly reducing costs. Efficiently directing operational and maintenance expenses or capital expenditures to distribution systems—primarily pipeline and service connection repair, refurbishment, or replacement—can improve company value and provide strong investment returns.

## Metrics

### IF-WU-140a.1. Water main replacement rate

1 The entity shall disclose its water main replacement rate for the distribution system(s) that it owns and/or operates.

1.1 The distribution system is defined, as including all water utility components for the distribution of finished or potable water to customers or other users. This includes the distribution of water for non-potable uses, including fire suppression.

2 The percentage shall be calculated as the total length of pipe replaced during the reporting period divided by the total length of water mains in its distribution system.

2.1 The scope of water main replacements includes complete main replacements, as well as rehabilitations and/or renewals that substantially extend the life of the water main.

2    Relevant challenges to describe include, but are not limited to, the impacts of corrosion and soil properties on pipe materials (e.g., cast iron, ductile iron, polyvinyl chloride, and wood), the entity's ability to finance maintenance and replacement through rate adjustments, and the age of the current distribution network.

IF-WU-140a.2. Volume of non-revenue real water losses

1    The entity shall disclose the amount, in cubic meters, of non-revenue real water losses from the distribution system.

1.1    Non-revenue real water losses are defined, as the physical water losses, which are not billed and produce no revenue, from the pressurized system and the utility's storage tanks up to the point of customer consumption, which is the customer meter for those utilities that meter their customers. In unmetered systems, the delineation is the point at which the customer becomes responsible for customer service connection piping maintenance and repairs. Real losses include leakage from mains and service connections and storage tank overflows.

2    The entity shall calculate the amount of non-revenue real water losses according to national, state, or local regulations where such loss occurs.

3    The scope of disclosure is limited to water operations and services (i.e., wastewater and stormwater services are excluded).

# End-Use Efficiency

## Topic Summary

Water efficiency and conservation at the consumer level, whether a product of government mandates, environmental consciousness, or demographic trends, is increasingly important for long-term resource availability and the financial performance of the water supply segment of the industry. The end-use efficiency topic addresses how utilities work with regulators to mitigate revenue declines in the context of the increasing need for resource efficiency. Water efficiency mechanisms, including rate decoupling, can ensure that a utility's revenue can adequately cover its fixed costs and provide the desired levels of returns regardless of sales volume, while simultaneously incentivizing customers to conserve water. Efficiency mechanisms can better align utilities' economic incentives with environmental and social interests, including resource efficiency, lower rates, and increased capital investments in infrastructure. Water utilities are able to manage their exposure to the impact of rate mechanisms through positive regulatory relations, forward-looking rate cases that incorporate efficiency, and a strong execution of efficiency strategy.

## Metrics

IF-WU-420a.1. Percentage of water utility revenues from rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience

1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of water utility revenues from rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience.

1.1 The scope of rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience is limited to rate structures that are explicitly and intentionally designed to:

1.1.1 Financially incentivize customers to reduce water consumption and/or improve water efficiency; and

1.1.2 Improve the revenue resilience of the water utility, primarily in circumstances of declining average customer water use and/or improving average customer water efficiency.

1.2 The scope of rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience includes, but is not limited to, revenue decoupled rate structures.

1.2.1 Revenue decoupled rate structures are defined as a rate adjustment mechanism that separates the utility's fixed cost recovery from the volume sold—and the utility's revenues are collected based on the regulatory determined revenue requirement.

1.2.2 Revenue decoupled rate structures may also be referred to as, "revenue regulation" or "revenue cap regulation," where the regulator establishes an allowed revenue requirement and adjusts collections so as to achieve that allowed, or 'target,' revenue irrespective of actual sales.

#### Page 415

1.2.3 Additional guidance on the scope of revenue decoupled rate structures is contained in Alternative Regulation and Ratemaking Approaches for Water Companies, The Brattle Group, September 23, 2013.

1.3 The scope of rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience includes, but is not limited to, rate structures that contain a lost revenue adjustment mechanism (LRAM).

1.3.1 Rate structures that contain an LRAM are defined as volumetric rates that contain a mechanism which allows the entity to recover revenues lost directly resulting from water conservation, water efficiency, and/or demand side management programs that are directly managed and/or implemented by the entity.

1.3.2 Additional guidance on the scope of revenue decoupled rate structures is contained in Alternative Regulation and Ratemaking Approaches for Water Companies, The Brattle Group, September 23, 2013.

1.3.3 The scope of LRAM includes mechanisms that allow the estimation of lost revenues based on the programs' actual impacts, but excludes lost revenues from planned or forecasted programs impacts (as described in Alternative Regulation and Ratemaking Approaches for Water Companies, The Brattle Group, September 23, 2013).

1.4 The scope of rate structures that are designed to promote conservation and revenue resilience excludes straight fixed-variable rate design, absent other rate mechanisms that are explicitly designed to promote conservation.

2 Water savings shall be defined according to the gross savings approach as the changes in water consumption and/or demand that result from program-related actions taken by participants in an efficiency program, regardless of why they participated.

#### Page 416

2.1 The entity should list those markets where it reports water savings on a net savings basis, and thus may be different from the figures disclosed here.

2.1.1 Net water savings are defined as changes in consumption that are specifically attributable to a water efficiency program and that would not otherwise have happened in the absence of the program.

3 Water savings shall be calculated on a gross basis but consistent with the methodology set forth in state or local evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) regulations where such savings occur.

4 Where state or local regulations do not exist, the entity shall calculate water savings in a manner consistent with the measurement and verification methods outlined by Efficiency Valuation Organization's (EVO) International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol: Concepts and Options for Determining Energy and Water Savings, Volume I (IPM&V Protocol).

5 The entity shall consider the EVO IPM&V Protocol and state regulations as normative references, thus any updates made year-on-year shall be considered updates to this guidance.

6 The scope of disclosure is limited to water operations and services (i.e., wastewater and stormwater services are excluded).

Note to IF-WU-420a.2

1 The entity shall describe customer efficiency measures that are required by regulations for each of its relevant markets, including a discussion of:

1.1 The amount or percentage of water savings from efficiency measures required by regulations for each market.

1.2 Instances of non-compliance with water savings obligations.

1.2.1 In such instances, the entity shall disclose the difference between the water savings delivered and the amount required by the regulation.

1.3 Water savings delivered that exceed those required by regulations that resulted in the entity receiving energy efficiency performance incentives, including the value of any such incentives.

2 3 The entity shall describe the forms of regulation in each market that allow for or incentivize water efficiency, including a discussion of the benefits, challenges, and financial impacts associated with such regulations.

# Water Supply Resilience

## Topic Summary

Water supply systems obtain water from groundwater and surface water sources. Water supplies may either be accessed directly or purchased from a third party, often a government entity. Water scarcity, water source contamination, infrastructure failures, regulatory restrictions, competing users, and overconsumption by customers are all factors that can jeopardize access to sufficient water supplies. These issues, combined with an increasing risk of extreme and frequent drought conditions due to climate change, may lead to inadequate supplies or mandated water restrictions. The related financial impacts may manifest in different ways, depending on rate structure, but are most likely to impact company value through decreased revenue. Water supply challenges may also lead to increases in the price of purchased water, which could result in higher operating costs. Failures of critical infrastructure such as aqueducts and canals, which could result from events such as earthquakes, are capable of presenting catastrophic risks to customers of the water supply system and could inflict untold financial consequences. Companies are able to mitigate water supply risks (and the resulting financial risks) through diversification of water supplies, sustainable withdrawal levels, technological and infrastructure improvements, contingency planning, positive relations with regulators and other major users, as well as rate structures.

# Network Resiliency & Impacts of Climate Change

## Topic Summary

Climate change is likely to create business uncertainty for water supply systems and wastewater systems due to potential impacts on infrastructure and operations. Climate change can lead to increased water stress, more frequent severe weather events, reduced water quality, and rising sea levels that could impair utility assets or the ability to operate. Water supply and wastewater disposal are basic services for which maintaining continuity is of utmost importance. The increasing frequency and severity of storms challenge water and wastewater treatment facilities, and can affect continuity of service. Intense precipitation may lead to sewage volumes that exceed the capacity of treatment facilities, resulting in the release of untreated effluent. Minimizing current and future risks of service disruptions and inadequate service quality can require additional capital expenditures and operational expenses. As climate change leads to a greater likelihood of extreme weather events, companies that address these risks through redundancies and strategic planning will be better able to serve customers and protect shareholder value.
