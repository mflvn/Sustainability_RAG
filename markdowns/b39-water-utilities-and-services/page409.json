Utility operating costs are directly related to energy use, which is typically a company's largest operating cost after purchased water, chemicals, and labor. Purchased grid electricity is the most common energy input. In more remote locations, on-site generation is used to power equipment. The inefficient use of purchased grid electricity creates environmental externalities, such as Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Regulations that address environmental concerns are likely to affect the future grid energy mix, leading to increases in prices. Additionally, climate change is also expected to impact grid reliability, and affect the availability of water resources. As a result, the energy intensity of water utilities is likely to increase in the future as water sources become more difficult to access. Alternative water treatment, such as recycling and desalination, can also require more energy. Together with decisions about the use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site electricity generation, energy efficiency can play an important role in influencing both the cost and the reliability of the energy supply.\n\n## Metrics\n\nIF-WU-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable\n\n1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.\n\n1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.\n\n2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy."}
