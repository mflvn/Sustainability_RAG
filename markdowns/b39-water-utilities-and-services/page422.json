Climate change can lead to increased water stress, more frequent severe weather events, reduced water quality, and rising sea levels that could impair utility assets or the ability to operate. Water supply and wastewater disposal are basic services for which maintaining continuity is of utmost importance. The increasing frequency and severity of storms challenge water and wastewater treatment facilities, and can affect continuity of service. Intense precipitation may lead to sewage volumes that exceed the capacity of treatment facilities, resulting in the release of untreated effluent. Minimizing current and future risks of service disruptions and inadequate service quality can require additional capital expenditures and operational expenses. As climate change leads to a greater likelihood of extreme weather events, companies that address these risks through redundancies and strategic planning will be better able to serve customers and protect shareholder value.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-WU-450a.1. Wastewater treatment capacity located in 100-year flood zones\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the capacity, in cubic meters per day, of its wastewater treatment facilities that are located in 100-year flood zones.\n\n1.1 100-year flood zones are defined as land areas subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Such areas may also be referred to as being subject to the one-percent annual chance flood, the one-percent annual exceedance probability flood, or the 100-year flood.\n\n1.1.1 Examples of 100-year flood zones may include, but are not limited to, coastal flood plains, flood plains along major rivers, and areas subject to flooding from ponding in low-lying areas.\n\n2 The scope of disclosure shall include all of the entity's wastewater treatment facilities that are located in 100-year flood zones, regardless of the country of their location.\n\n### IF-WU-450a.2. (1) Number and (2) volume of sanitary sewer overflows (SSO), (3) percentage of volume recovered\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the (1) number of sanitary sewer overflows (SSO) originating from sewer systems under the entity's operational control."}
