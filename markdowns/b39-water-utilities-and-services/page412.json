{"page_number": 412, "text_content": "# Distribution Network Efficiency\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nWater utilities develop, maintain, and operate complex interconnected infrastructure networks that include extensive pipelines, canals, reservoirs, and pump stations. Significant volumes of water are lost in the distribution network (called \"non-revenue water,\" as it is a distributed volume of water that is not reflected in customer billings). This water is lost primarily because of infrastructure failures and inefficiencies, such as leaking pipes and service connections. Non-revenue real water losses may negatively impact financial performance, raise customer rates, and squander water and other resources such as energy and treatment chemicals. Conversely, improvements to infrastructure and operating processes can limit non-revenue losses, positively impacting revenues and possibly reducing costs. Efficiently directing operational and maintenance expenses or capital expenditures to distribution systems\u2014primarily pipeline and service connection repair, refurbishment, or replacement\u2014can improve company value and provide strong investment returns.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-WU-140a.1. Water main replacement rate\n\n1 The entity shall disclose its water main replacement rate for the distribution system(s) that it owns and/or operates.\n\n1.1 The distribution system is defined, as including all water utility components for the distribution of finished or potable water to customers or other users. This includes the distribution of water for non-potable uses, including fire suppression.\n\n2 The percentage shall be calculated as the total length of pipe replaced during the reporting period divided by the total length of water mains in its distribution system.\n\n2.1 The scope of water main replacements includes complete main replacements, as well as rehabilitations and/or renewals that substantially extend the life of the water main.\n\n2.2 The scope of water main replacements excludes water main repairs.\n\n3 The scope of disclosure is limited to water operations and services (i.e., wastewater and stormwater services are excluded).\n\nNote to IF-WU-140a.1\n\n1 The entity shall describe the use of and challenges associated with planned and corrective maintenance in its distribution system, where:\n\n1.1 Corrective maintenance is defined, as all maintenance undertaken after asset failure."}
