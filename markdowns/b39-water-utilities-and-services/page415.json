Customer water savings from efficiency measures, by market\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the total volume of water savings, in cubic meters, from water efficiency measures installed or otherwise supported by the entity during the reporting period for each of its markets.\n\n1.1 Markets are defined as those operations that are subject to distinct public utility regulatory oversight.\n\n2 Water savings shall be defined according to the gross savings approach as the changes in water consumption and/or demand that result from program-related actions taken by participants in an efficiency program, regardless of why they participated."}
