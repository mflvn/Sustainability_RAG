Volume of non-revenue real water losses\n\n1    The entity shall disclose the amount, in cubic meters, of non-revenue real water losses from the distribution system.\n\n1.1    Non-revenue real water losses are defined, as the physical water losses, which are not billed and produce no revenue, from the pressurized system and the utility's storage tanks up to the point of customer consumption, which is the customer meter for those utilities that meter their customers. In unmetered systems, the delineation is the point at which the customer becomes responsible for customer service connection piping maintenance and repairs. Real losses include leakage from mains and service connections and storage tank overflows.\n\n2    The entity shall calculate the amount of non-revenue real water losses according to national, state, or local regulations where such loss occurs.\n\n3    The scope of disclosure is limited to water operations and services (i.e., wastewater and stormwater services are excluded).\n\n4    Where national, state, or local regulations do not exist, the entity shall calculate the amount of real losses according to voluntary initiatives.\n\n5    The entity may disclose the technique(s) it employs to measure non-revenue water from real losses and the amount calculated according to each technique it employs.", "page_number": 413}
