{"page_number": 416, "text_content": "2.1 The entity should list those markets where it reports water savings on a net savings basis, and thus may be different from the figures disclosed here.\n\n2.1.1 Net water savings are defined as changes in consumption that are specifically attributable to a water efficiency program and that would not otherwise have happened in the absence of the program.\n\n3 Water savings shall be calculated on a gross basis but consistent with the methodology set forth in state or local evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) regulations where such savings occur.\n\n4 Where state or local regulations do not exist, the entity shall calculate water savings in a manner consistent with the measurement and verification methods outlined by Efficiency Valuation Organization's (EVO) International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol: Concepts and Options for Determining Energy and Water Savings, Volume I (IPM&V Protocol).\n\n5 The entity shall consider the EVO IPM&V Protocol and state regulations as normative references, thus any updates made year-on-year shall be considered updates to this guidance.\n\n6 The scope of disclosure is limited to water operations and services (i.e., wastewater and stormwater services are excluded).\n\nNote to IF-WU-420a.2\n\n1 The entity shall describe customer efficiency measures that are required by regulations for each of its relevant markets, including a discussion of:\n\n1.1 The amount or percentage of water savings from efficiency measures required by regulations for each market.\n\n1.2 Instances of non-compliance with water savings obligations.\n\n1.2.1 In such instances, the entity shall disclose the difference between the water savings delivered and the amount required by the regulation.\n\n1.3 Water savings delivered that exceed those required by regulations that resulted in the entity receiving energy efficiency performance incentives, including the value of any such incentives.\n\n2 3 The entity shall describe the forms of regulation in each market that allow for or incentivize water efficiency, including a discussion of the benefits, challenges, and financial impacts associated with such regulations.\n\n3 4 Relevant policy mechanisms to discuss include, but are not limited to:\n\n3.1 4.1 Deferral decoupling\n\n3.2 4.2 Current period decoupling"}
