Data centers need to be powered continuously, and disruptions to the energy supply can have a material impact on operations, depending on the magnitude and timing of the disruption. Companies also face a tradeoff when it comes to energy and water consumption for their data center cooling needs: Cooling data centers with water instead of chillers is a means of improving energy efficiency, but it can lead to dependence on significant local water resources. Companies that effectively manage this issue may benefit from cost savings and minimize reputational risks, as there is growing concern over energy and water use.\n\n## Metrics\n\nCG-EC-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable\n\n1. The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n   1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n   1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.\n\n   1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n2. The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.\n\n   2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3. The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.\n\n   3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.\n\n   3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption."}
