The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources.\n\n   1.1 Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities.\n\n2. The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources.\n\n   2.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n   2.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n3. The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.\n\n   3.1 Water consumption is defined as:\n\n      3.1.1 Water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge;\n\n      3.1.2 Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service;\n\n      3.1.3 Water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea.\n\n4. The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40\u201380 percent) or Extremely High (>80 percent) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.\n\n5. The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn.\n\n6. The entity shall disclose its water consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water consumed.\n\n# CG-EC-130a.3. Discussion of the integration of environmental considerations into strategic planning for data center needs\n\n1. The entity shall discuss the environmental considerations that it integrates into siting, design, construction, refurbishment, and operational specifications for its data centers, including factors related to energy and water consumption.\n", "page_number": 29}
