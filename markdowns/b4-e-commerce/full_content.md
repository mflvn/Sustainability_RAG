# Industry Description

The E-Commerce industry is composed of firms that provide an online marketplace for other firms or individuals to sell their goods and services, as well as retailers and wholesalers that provide an exclusively web-based platform for consumers to buy goods and services. Firms in this industry sell to consumers as well as to other businesses. Because of the accessibility of e-commerce sites, the industry is a global marketplace for buyers and sellers. Note: The industry scope exclusively applies to "pure-play" e-commerce operations and does not address the manufacturing or brick-and-mortar retail operations of companies. Many consumer goods manufacturers and retailers have incorporated, or are in the process of incorporating, an e-commerce component to their business. SASB has separate standards for the Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors (CG-MR); Apparel, Accessories & Footwear (CG-AA); and Toys & Sporting Goods (CG-TS) industries. Depending on the specific activities and operations of firms in the aforementioned industries, disclosure topics and accounting metrics associated with the E-Commerce industry standard may also be relevant.

6 Note to CG-EC-000.A – The entity shall define and disclose a basic measure of user activity suitable for its business activities. This measure may be sales transactions, purchase transactions, number of searches, monthly active users, page views, and/or unique URLs.

# Hardware Infrastructure Energy & Water Management

## Topic Summary

A large part of the energy consumed by the E-Commerce industry is used to power critical hardware and IT infrastructure in data centers. Data centers need to be powered continuously, and disruptions to the energy supply can have a material impact on operations, depending on the magnitude and timing of the disruption. Companies also face a tradeoff when it comes to energy and water consumption for their data center cooling needs: Cooling data centers with water instead of chillers is a means of improving energy efficiency, but it can lead to dependence on significant local water resources. Companies that effectively manage this issue may benefit from cost savings and minimize reputational risks, as there is growing concern over energy and water use.

# Product Packaging & Distribution

## Topic Summary

A significant part of the E-Commerce industry's added value comes from firms' ability to move a wide array of goods efficiently to consumers who would otherwise have to personally travel to collect the goods from brick-and-mortar stores. As the volume of packaging shipments increases, the industry may become more exposed to environmental externalities, such as carbon pricing and subsequent rising fuel costs that present risks associated with the shipping of products. While firms that outsource shipping and logistics have less control over the specific processes of shipping operations, they can still select suppliers with more energy-efficient business practices. As this is a highly competitive and low-margin industry, the ability to shave off shipping costs through fuel reduction and more efficient routing can allow firms to pass those savings on to their customers. Additionally, e-commerce firms have an incentive to minimize the use of packaging. Efficient packaging can lead to cost savings from reducing the amount of material that needs to be purchased, as well as saving on logistics costs, as more products can fit into a single shipping load.
