{"page_number": 25, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe E-Commerce industry is composed of firms that provide an online marketplace for other firms or individuals to sell their goods and services, as well as retailers and wholesalers that provide an exclusively web-based platform for consumers to buy goods and services. Firms in this industry sell to consumers as well as to other businesses. Because of the accessibility of e-commerce sites, the industry is a global marketplace for buyers and sellers. Note: The industry scope exclusively applies to \"pure-play\" e-commerce operations and does not address the manufacturing or brick-and-mortar retail operations of companies. Many consumer goods manufacturers and retailers have incorporated, or are in the process of incorporating, an e-commerce component to their business. SASB has separate standards for the Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors (CG-MR); Apparel, Accessories & Footwear (CG-AA); and Toys & Sporting Goods (CG-TS) industries. Depending on the specific activities and operations of firms in the aforementioned industries, disclosure topics and accounting metrics associated with the E-Commerce industry standard may also be relevant.\n\n6 Note to CG-EC-000.A \u2013 The entity shall define and disclose a basic measure of user activity suitable for its business activities.
