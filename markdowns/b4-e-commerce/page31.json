As the volume of packaging shipments increases, the industry may become more exposed to environmental externalities, such as carbon pricing and subsequent rising fuel costs that present risks associated with the shipping of products. While firms that outsource shipping and logistics have less control over the specific processes of shipping operations, they can still select suppliers with more energy-efficient business practices. As this is a highly competitive and low-margin industry, the ability to shave off shipping costs through fuel reduction and more efficient routing can allow firms to pass those savings on to their customers. Additionally, e-commerce firms have an incentive to minimize the use of packaging. Efficient packaging can lead to cost savings from reducing the amount of material that needs to be purchased, as well as saving on logistics costs, as more products can fit into a single shipping load.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### CG-EC-410a.1. Total greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of product shipments\n\n1. The entity shall disclose the complete tank-to-wheels greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint, in metric tons of CO\u2082-e, associated with outbound shipment of the entity's products.\n\n   1.1 Tank-to-wheels emissions relate to vehicle processes and exclude upstream emissions associated with primary energy production (i.e., well-to-tank emissions).\n\n   1.2 The entity shall calculate its disclosure according to EN 16258:2012, Methodology for calculation and declaration of energy consumption and GHG emissions of transport services (freight and passengers).\n\n      1.2.1 Calculations shall be consistent with the methodology used to calculate the \"tank-to-wheels GHG emissions (Gt)\" result that is described in EN 16258:2012.\n\n      1.2.2 Determination of transportation system scope, boundaries, and any necessary allocations shall be consistent with the methodology described in EN 16258:2012.\n\n2. The scope of disclosure includes emissions from all freight transportation and logistics activities associated with outbound shipment of the entity's products, including those from contract carriers and outsourced freight forwarding services and logistics providers (Scope 3) as well as those from the entity's own assets (Scope 1).\n\n3. The scope of disclosure includes emissions from all modes of transportation, such as road freight, air freight, barge transport, marine transport, and rail transport."}
