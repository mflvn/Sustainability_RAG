Energy-intense production has implications for climate change, and electricity purchases from the grid can create indirect Scope 2 emissions. Construction materials companies also use alternative fuels for their kilns, such as scrap tires and waste oil\u2014often waste generated by other industries. If properly managed, these can lower energy costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, there could be potentially negative impacts, such as releases of harmful air pollutants that companies need to minimize in order to obtain net benefits from using such fuels. Decisions about use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site generation of electricity (versus purchases from the grid) can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of energy supply. Affordable, easily accessible, and reliable energy is an important competitive factor in this industry, with purchased fuels and electricity accounting for a significant proportion of total production costs. The way in which a construction materials company manages its overall energy efficiency, its reliance on different types of energy and associated sustainability risks, and its ability to access alternative sources of energy can influence its profitability.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-CM-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage alternative, (4) percentage renewable\n\n1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.\n\n1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.\n\n2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that was from alternative sources, in terms of its energy content."}
