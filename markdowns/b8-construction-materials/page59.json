Emissions of particular concern include nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, heavy metals (e.g., mercury), dioxins, and volatile organic compounds, among others. These air emissions can have significant, localized human health and environmental impacts. Financial impacts resulting from air emissions will vary depending on the specific location of operations and the applicable air emissions regulations, but could include higher operating or capital expenditures and regulatory or legal penalties. Active management of the issue\u2014through technological and process improvements\u2014could allow companies to limit the impact of regulations and benefit from operational efficiencies that could lead to a lower cost structure over time.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-CM-120a.1. Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) NOx (excluding N2O), (2) SOx, (3) particulate matter (PM10), (4) dioxins/furans, (5) volatile organic compounds (VOCs), (6) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and (7) heavy metals\n\n1 The entity shall disclose its emissions of air pollutants, in metric tons per pollutant, that are released into the atmosphere.\n\n1.1 The scope of disclosure includes air pollutants associated with the entity's direct air emissions resulting from all of the entity's activities and sources of emissions, including, but not limited to, stationary and mobile sources, production facilities, office buildings, and transportation fleets.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose its emissions of (1) oxides of nitrogen (NOX), reported as NOX.\n\n2.1 The scope of NOX includes NO and NO2, but excludes N2O.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose its emissions of (2) oxides of sulfur (SOX), reported as SOX.\n\n3.1 The scope of SOX includes SO2 and SO3.\n\n4 The entity shall disclose its emissions of (3) particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter (PM10), reported as PM10.\n\n4.1 PM10 is defined as any airborne finely divided solid or liquid material with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers.\n\n5 The entity shall disclose its emissions of (4) dioxins/furans.\n\n5.1 Dioxins/furans include, but are not limited to the sum of the 17 congeners of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) that contain chlorine"}
