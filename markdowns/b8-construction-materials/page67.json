{"text_content": "# Product Innovation\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nInnovations in building materials are a key component in the growth of sustainable construction. Consumer and regulatory trends are largely driving adoption of sustainable building materials and processes that are more resource efficient and can reduce health impacts of buildings throughout their lifecycle. This is creating new business drivers for construction materials companies, with an opportunity to increase revenues. Furthermore, some new products require less energy to produce, or use largely recycled inputs, reducing production costs. Sustainable construction materials, therefore, can contribute to a company's long-term growth and competitiveness.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### EM-CM-410a.1. Percentage of products that qualify for credits in sustainable building design and construction certifications\n\n1. The entity shall calculate the percentage as the revenue during the reporting period from products that qualify for credits in recognized sustainable design and construction certifications divided by the total revenue from building products.\n\n    1.1 The scope of products excludes raw or intermediate materials that would require additional manufacturing before being incorporated into a building; the entity shall exclude these products from the numerator and denominator of its calculations.\n\n2. Recognized sustainable building design and construction certifications and guidelines include: BREEAM\u00ae (BRE Global), Green Globes\u00ae (Green Building Initiative), LEED\u00ae (U.S. Green Building Council), and ICC-700 National Green Building Standard\u00ae (National Association of Home Builders).\u00b9\u2070\n\n    2.1 If the entity's products can be used to obtain credits in certifications other than those described above, it shall provide the name of the certification and evidence of why it is equal to or more rigorous than those standards listed here.\n\n3. The entity may disclose and discuss which specific products contribute to sustainable building practices and future plans to address market demand for these types of products.\n\n### EM-CM-410a.2. Total addressable market and share of market for products that reduce energy, water, and/or material impacts during usage and/or production\n\n1. The entity shall provide an estimation of the total addressable market for products that show reduced environmental impacts at various lifecycle stages, including during material sourcing, manufacturing, and product usage (hereafter, \"reduced environmental impact products\").\n\n\u00b9\u2070 SASB is not affiliated with any of the standards or organization listed, and listing should not be taken as an endorsement of any standard or organization. Listing of standards is not meant to imply that standards are identical in scope, underlying requirements, or criteria, or that standards are interchangeable.", "page_number": 67}
