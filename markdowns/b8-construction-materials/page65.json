However, wastes from production processes, pollution control devices, and from hazardous waste management activities present a regulatory risk and can raise operating costs. Cement kiln dust (CKD) \u2014consisting of fine-grained, solid, highly alkaline waste removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices\u2014is the most significant waste category in the industry. Regulatory risk remains from evolving environmental laws, including those at local and national levels and for other waste streams. Companies that reduce waste streams\u2014hazardous waste streams in particular\u2014and recycle by-products, can therefore lower regulatory and litigation risks and costs.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-CM-150a.1. Amount of waste generated, percentage hazardous, percentage recycled\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of waste generated in metric tons.\n\n1.1 Waste is defined as anything for which the entity has no further use and which is discarded or is released to the environment.\n\n1.2 The scope includes slags, dusts, sludges, used oil, and other solid wastes that meet the above definition.\n\n1.3 The scope excludes gaseous wastes.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose the percentage of waste generated that was hazardous.\n\n2.1 The percentage of hazardous waste shall be calculated as the weight of hazardous waste as defined per the legal or regulatory framework(s) applicable within the jurisdiction(s) where the waste is generated divided by the total weight of waste material.\n\n2.2 Hazardous waste generally includes those that display the following characteristics: ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity.\n\n2.3 The entity may use Subtitle C of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) or the EU Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, including its subsequent amendments) for the purposes of defining hazardous waste for operations located in jurisdictions that lack applicable legal or regulatory definitions.\n\n2.4 The entity shall disclose the applicable jurisdictional standard or regulation used to define hazardous waste.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose the percentage of waste generated that was recycled."}
