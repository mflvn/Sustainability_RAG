# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

The production of construction materials, particularly cement, generates significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from on-site fuel combustion and chemical processes. The industry has achieved gains in efficiency for reducing emissions per ton of materials produced. At the same time, increasing production is associated with an increase in absolute emissions from cement production. The production of construction materials remains carbon-intensive relative to other industries, exposing the industry to higher operating and capital expenditures from emissions regulations. Strategies to reduce GHG emissions include: energy efficiency, use of alternative and renewable fuels, carbon sequestration, and clinker substitution. Operational efficiencies can be achieved through the cost-effective reduction of GHG emissions. Such efficiencies can mitigate the potential financial impact of increased fuel costs as well as direct emissions from regulations that seek to limit—or put a price on—GHG emissions.

## Metrics

# Air Quality

## Topic Summary

On-site fuel combustion and production processes in the Construction Materials industry emit criteria air pollutants and hazardous chemicals, including small quantities of organic compounds and heavy metals. Emissions of particular concern include nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, heavy metals (e.g., mercury), dioxins, and volatile organic compounds, among others. These air emissions can have significant, localized human health and environmental impacts. Financial impacts resulting from air emissions will vary depending on the specific location of operations and the applicable air emissions regulations, but could include higher operating or capital expenditures and regulatory or legal penalties. Active management of the issue—through technological and process improvements—could allow companies to limit the impact of regulations and benefit from operational efficiencies that could lead to a lower cost structure over time.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

The production of construction materials requires a significant quantity of energy, sourced primarily from direct combustion of fossil fuels as well as from purchased electricity. Energy-intense production has implications for climate change, and electricity purchases from the grid can create indirect Scope 2 emissions. Construction materials companies also use alternative fuels for their kilns, such as scrap tires and waste oil—often waste generated by other industries. If properly managed, these can lower energy costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, there could be potentially negative impacts, such as releases of harmful air pollutants that companies need to minimize in order to obtain net benefits from using such fuels. Decisions about use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site generation of electricity (versus purchases from the grid) can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of energy supply. Affordable, easily accessible, and reliable energy is an important competitive factor in this industry, with purchased fuels and electricity accounting for a significant proportion of total production costs. The way in which a construction materials company manages its overall energy efficiency, its reliance on different types of energy and associated sustainability risks, and its ability to access alternative sources of energy can influence its profitability.

## Metrics

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

The production of construction materials requires substantial volumes of water for the production process. Companies face operational, regulatory, and reputational risks due to water scarcity, costs of water acquisition, regulations on effluents or amount of water used, and competition with local communities and other industries for limited water resources. Risks are likely to be higher in regions of water scarcity, due to potential water availability constraints and price volatility. Companies that are unable to secure a stable water supply could face production disruptions, while rising water prices could directly increase production costs. Consequently, the adoption of technologies and processes that reduce water consumption could lower operating risks and costs for companies by minimizing the impact of regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions on company operations.

## Metrics

EM-CM-140a.1. (1) Total fresh water withdrawn, (2) percentage recycled, (3) percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

#### Page 65

# Waste Management

## Topic Summary

Recycling rates in construction materials production are high. However, wastes from production processes, pollution control devices, and from hazardous waste management activities present a regulatory risk and can raise operating costs. Cement kiln dust (CKD) —consisting of fine-grained, solid, highly alkaline waste removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices—is the most significant waste category in the industry. Regulatory risk remains from evolving environmental laws, including those at local and national levels and for other waste streams. Companies that reduce waste streams—hazardous waste streams in particular—and recycle by-products, can therefore lower regulatory and litigation risks and costs.

## Metrics

EM-CM-150a.1. Amount of waste generated, percentage hazardous, percentage recycled

1 The entity shall disclose the amount of waste generated in metric tons.

1.1 Waste is defined as anything for which the entity has no further use and which is discarded or is released to the environment.

1.2 The scope includes slags, dusts, sludges, used oil, and other solid wastes that meet the above definition.

1.3 The scope excludes gaseous wastes.

2 The entity shall disclose the percentage of waste generated that was hazardous.

2.1 The percentage of hazardous waste shall be calculated as the weight of hazardous waste as defined per the legal or regulatory framework(s) applicable within the jurisdiction(s) where the waste is generated divided by the total weight of waste material.

2.2 Hazardous waste generally includes those that display the following characteristics: ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity.

2.3 The entity may use Subtitle C of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) or the EU Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, including its subsequent amendments) for the purposes of defining hazardous waste for operations located in jurisdictions that lack applicable legal or regulatory definitions.

2.4 The entity shall disclose the applicable jurisdictional standard or regulation used to define hazardous waste.

3 The entity shall disclose the percentage of waste generated that was recycled.

#### Page 66

3.1 The percentage recycled shall be calculated as the weight of waste material that was reused, plus the weight recycled or remanufactured (through treatment or processing) by the entity, plus the amount sent externally for further recycling, divided by the total weight of waste material, where:

3.1.1 Reused materials are defined as those recovered products or components of products that are used for the same purpose for which they were conceived.

3.1.2 Recycled and remanufactured materials are defined as waste materials that have been reprocessed or treated by means of production or manufacturing processes and made into a final product or made into a component for incorporation into a product.

3.1.3 The scope of recycled and remanufactured products include primary recycled materials, co-products (outputs of equal value to primary recycled materials), and by-products (outputs of lesser value to primary recycled materials).

3.1.4 Portions of products and materials that are disposed of in landfills are not considered recycled; only the portions of products that are directly incorporated into new products, co-products, or by-products shall be included in the percentage recycled.

3.1.5 Materials sent for further recycling include those materials which are transferred to a third party for the expressed purpose of reuse, recycling, or refurbishment.

3.2 Materials incinerated, including for energy recovery, shall not be considered within the scope of recycled materials.

3.2.1 Energy recovery is defined as the use of combustible waste as a means to generate energy through direct incineration, with or without other waste, but with recovery of the heat.

3.2.2 The entity may separately disclose the percentage of hazardous waste generated that was incinerated.

# Product Innovation

## Topic Summary

Innovations in building materials are a key component in the growth of sustainable construction. Consumer and regulatory trends are largely driving adoption of sustainable building materials and processes that are more resource efficient and can reduce health impacts of buildings throughout their lifecycle. This is creating new business drivers for construction materials companies, with an opportunity to increase revenues. Furthermore, some new products require less energy to produce, or use largely recycled inputs, reducing production costs. Sustainable construction materials, therefore, can contribute to a company's long-term growth and competitiveness.

## Metrics
