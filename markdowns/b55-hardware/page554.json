Rapid obsolescence of hardware products exacerbates the externalities. Companies are therefore designing more products with the entire lifecycle in mind. Specific considerations include energy efficiency of products, hazardous material inputs, and designing for and facilitating safe end-of-life disposal and recycling. Companies that prioritize designing and manufacturing products with improved environmental and social impacts can avoid costs associated with externalities, and are more likely to grow consumer demand and market share, while eliminating potentially harmful materials. Furthermore, companies that are able to minimize environmental and social externalities of products will be less exposed to increasing regulation and costs, such as those related to extended producer responsibility.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### TC-HW-410a.1.
