# Industry Description

The Hardware industry consists of companies that design and sell technology hardware products, including computers, consumer electronics, communications equipment, storage devices, components, and peripherals. Many companies in the industry rely heavily on the Electronic Manufacturing Services & Original Design Manufacturing (EMS & ODM) industry for manufacturing services. The industry is expected to continue to grow as the use of technology rapidly grows, especially from consumers in emerging markets.

Note: Companies engaged in activities of the Software & IT Services industry (TC-SI), Internet Media & Services (TC-IM) industry, and/or the EMS & ODM industry (TC-ES) should consider the separate SASB standards for these industries.

# Product Lifecycle Management

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Hardware industry face increasing challenges associated with environmental and social externalities attributed to product manufacturing, transport, use, and disposal. Rapid obsolescence of hardware products exacerbates the externalities. Companies are therefore designing more products with the entire lifecycle in mind. Specific considerations include energy efficiency of products, hazardous material inputs, and designing for and facilitating safe end-of-life disposal and recycling. Companies that prioritize designing and manufacturing products with improved environmental and social impacts can avoid costs associated with externalities, and are more likely to grow consumer demand and market share, while eliminating potentially harmful materials. Furthermore, companies that are able to minimize environmental and social externalities of products will be less exposed to increasing regulation and costs, such as those related to extended producer responsibility.

## Metrics

### TC-HW-410a.1. Percentage of products by revenue that contain IEC 62474 declarable substances

1 The entity shall disclose percentage of its products sold during the reporting period that contain declarable substances.

1.1 A product is considered to contain a declarable substance if, according to International Electrotechnical Commission's IEC 62474 – Material Declaration for Products of and for the Electrotechnical Industry, the product contains an amount of the declarable substance that is:

1.1.1 Above the "reporting threshold"

1.1.2 Within the scope of the "reporting application" identified

1.1.3 Within mandatory "reporting requirement"

1.2 The entity shall calculate the percentage as the revenue from electrical, electronic, and related technology products sold that contain a declarable substance(s) divided by total revenue from electrical, electronic, and related technology products sold.

2 The scope of disclosure includes all electrical, electronic, and related technology products, including products from a company not required to declare, or otherwise making declarations, according to IEC 62474.

Note to TC-HW-410a.1

1 The entity shall describe its approach to managing the use of substances that appear as declarable substance groups or declarable substances in IEC 62474, including a discussion of specific operational processes during which use of these substances is considered and the actions the entity has taken to manage the use of these substances.

1.1 Relevant management approaches and actions to describe may include, but are not limited to:

#### Page 555

1.1.1 Product design criteria for the exclusion of substances (e.g., banned substances lists)

1.1.2 Use of material substitution assessments, materials and parts procurement guidelines, product safety testing, product declarations (e.g., material safety data sheets), and product labeling

2 If the entity assesses and manages the impact of known or potentially toxic substances with reference to other regulations, industry norms, or accepted chemical lists, it may identify those practices, and it shall describe the degree of overlap with IEC 62474.

TC-HW-410a.2. Percentage of eligible products, by revenue, meeting the requirements for EPEAT registration or equivalent

1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of its products sold during the reporting period that meet the requirements for Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) registration or an equivalent standard.

1.1 A product meets the requirements of EPEAT registration if it appears on the EPEAT Registry, or the entity can otherwise demonstrate that the product meets these requirements.

1.2 Standards that are equivalent to EPEAT include those that have criteria and requirements covering substantially similar topics, such as addressing:

1.2.1 Reduction or elimination of environmentally sensitive materials
1.2.2 Material selection and declaration
1.2.3 Design for end-of-life
1.2.4 Product longevity or lifecycle extension
1.2.5 Energy conservation
1.2.6 End-of-life management
1.2.7 Corporate performance
1.2.8 Packaging

1.3 Examples of standards that are equivalent to EPEAT include, but are not limited to, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Development fourth generation family of standards.

2 The entity shall calculate the percentage as the revenue from products sold during the reporting period that meet the requirements for EPEAT registration, or an equivalent standard, divided by total revenue from products eligible for EPEAT registration.

2.1 Eligible products are those in a product category for which EPEAT registration exists, which includes desktop computers, notebook computers, computer displays, and mobile phones.

2.2 Product categories not currently within the scope of EPEAT registration but for which there is an equivalent standard may be considered eligible products.

TC-HW-410a.4. Weight of end-of-life products and e-waste recovered, percentage recycled

1 The entity shall disclose the weight, in metric tons, of end-of-life material that was recovered, including through reverse logistics services, recycling services, product take-back programs, and refurbishment services.

1.1 End-of-life material that was recovered is defined as products, materials, and parts, including electronic waste material (e-waste), that at the end of their useful life would have otherwise been disposed of as waste or used for energy recovery, but have instead been collected.

1.2 The scope of end-of-life material that was recovered includes materials physically handled by the entity.

1.3 The scope of end-of-life material that was recovered also includes materials that the entity did not take physical possession of, but were collected by a third party for the expressed purpose of reuse, recycling, or refurbishment.

1.4 The scope of end-of-life material that was recovered excludes materials that have been collected for repair or that are in-warranty and subject to recall.

2 The entity shall disclose the percentage of end-of-life material that was recovered and subsequently recycled.

2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as the weight of end-of-life material that was recovered and subsequently recycled divided by the total weight of end-of-life material that was recovered.

2.2 Recycled material (including remanufactured material) is defined as waste material that has been reprocessed or treated by means of production or manufacturing processes and made into a final product or a component for incorporation into a product.

2.3 The scope of recycled material includes material that was reused or reclaimed.

2.4 The scope of recycled material includes primary recycled material, co-products (outputs of equal value to primary recycled materials), by-products (outputs of lesser value to primary recycled materials), and material sent externally for further recycling.

2.5 The scope of recycled material excludes portions of products and materials that are disposed of in landfills.

2.6 Electronic waste material (e-waste) shall be considered recycled only if the entity can demonstrate that this material was transferred to entities with third-party certification to a standard for e-waste recycling such as Basel Action Network's e-Steward® standard.

2.6.1 The entity shall disclose the standard(s) with which the entities it has transferred e-waste to are compliant.
