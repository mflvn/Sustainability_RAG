# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Water is vital to the Household & Personal Products industry, both as a coolant in manufacturing processes and as a main input for many of the industry's products. Water is becoming a scarcer resource around the world due to increasing consumption as a result of population growth, rapid urbanization, and reduced supplies due to drought and climate change. Many firms in this industry have operations in regions of the world that are facing water scarcity. Without careful planning, companies could face increased costs or, worse, lose access to water in these regions, thereby presenting a risk to production. Having rigorous checks in place to ensure a steady supply of water to all factories, as well as investing in technology to increase the efficiency of water use, will help firms in this industry keep a lower risk profile as water scarcity becomes a more pressing global issue.

# Environmental & Social Impacts of Palm Oil Supply Chain

## Topic Summary

Palm oil has rapidly risen in popularity as a cheap input for a wide range of goods in the
Household & Personal Products industry, including cleaning products, candles, and
cosmetics. Palm oil harvesting in specific regions of the world can contribute to
deforestation, GHG emissions, and other environmental and social problems. If not
sourced responsibly, palm oil materials contribute to environmental and social
externalities that can present reputational and regulatory risks for companies. Further,
companies in this industry are exposed to the risk of supply chain disruptions, input
price increases, and reputational damage associated with environmental and social
externalities from palm oil sourcing. Thus, companies face pressure to track and
responsibly source palm oil. Additionally, they face pressure to ensure minimum
standards for working conditions in the supply chain, as the production of palm oil is
often associated with labor issues. Implementing sourcing standards can contribute to
reducing risks, as can innovations at the product-design phase to reduce dependence on
controversial materials such as palm oil.

## Metrics

CG-HP-430a.1. Amount of palm oil sourced, percentage certified through the
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) supply chains as (a) Identity
Preserved, (b) Segregated, (c) Mass Balance, or (d) Book & Claim

1    The entity shall disclose the amount, in metric tons, of palm oil that it sourced
     during the reporting period.

     1.1   The scope of palm oil includes palm kernel oil and palm kernel expeller.

2    The entity shall disclose the percentage, on a weight basis, of palm oil it sourced
     that has been third-party certified to bear a Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil
     (RSPO) claim for each of the RSPO supply chain models: (a) Identity Preserved (IP),
     (b) Segregated (SG), (c) Mass Balance (MB), or (d) Book & Claim (B&C).

     2.1   B&C transactions are represented by "RSPO Credits" purchased in the RSPO
           PalmTrace platform.

     2.2   The percentage shall be calculated as the weight in each respective RSPO
           supply chain model (IP, SG, MB, or B&C) of RSPO-certified palm oil sourced
           by the entity divided by the total weight, in metric tons, of palm oil
           sourced by the entity.

3    The entity may discuss other strategies, approaches, and mechanisms used to
     manage risks and opportunities associated with the environmental and social
     impacts of palm oil sourcing.
