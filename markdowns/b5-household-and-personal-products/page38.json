{"text_content": "# Environmental & Social Impacts of Palm Oil Supply Chain\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nPalm oil has rapidly risen in popularity as a cheap input for a wide range of goods in the\nHousehold & Personal Products industry, including cleaning products, candles, and\ncosmetics. Palm oil harvesting in specific regions of the world can contribute to\ndeforestation, GHG emissions, and other environmental and social problems. If not\nsourced responsibly, palm oil materials contribute to environmental and social\nexternalities that can present reputational and regulatory risks for companies. Further,\ncompanies in this industry are exposed to the risk of supply chain disruptions, input\nprice increases, and reputational damage associated with environmental and social\nexternalities from palm oil sourcing. Thus, companies face pressure to track and\nresponsibly source palm oil. Additionally, they face pressure to ensure minimum\nstandards for working conditions in the supply chain, as the production of palm oil is\noften associated with labor issues. Implementing sourcing standards can contribute to\nreducing risks, as can innovations at the product-design phase to reduce dependence on\ncontroversial materials such as palm oil.\n\n## Metrics\n\nCG-HP-430a.1. Amount of palm oil sourced, percentage certified through the\nRoundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) supply chains as (a) Identity\nPreserved, (b) Segregated, (c) Mass Balance, or (d) Book & Claim\n\n1    The entity shall disclose the amount, in metric tons, of palm oil that it sourced\n     during the reporting period.\n\n     1.1   The scope of palm oil includes palm kernel oil and palm kernel expeller.\n\n2    The entity shall disclose the percentage, on a weight basis, of palm oil it sourced\n     that has been third-party certified to bear a Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil\n     (RSPO) claim for each of the RSPO supply chain models: (a) Identity Preserved (IP),\n     (b) Segregated (SG), (c) Mass Balance (MB), or (d) Book & Claim (B&C).\n\n     2.1   B&C transactions are represented by \"RSPO Credits\" purchased in the RSPO\n           PalmTrace platform.\n\n     2.2   The percentage shall be calculated as the weight in each respective RSPO\n           supply chain model (IP, SG, MB, or B&C) of RSPO-certified palm oil sourced\n           by the entity divided by the total weight, in metric tons, of palm oil\n           sourced by the entity.\n\n3    The entity may discuss other strategies, approaches, and mechanisms used to\n     manage risks and opportunities associated with the environmental and social\n     impacts of palm oil sourcing.", "page_number": 38}
