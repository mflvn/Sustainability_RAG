Water is becoming a scarcer resource around the world due to increasing consumption as a result of population growth, rapid urbanization, and reduced supplies due to drought and climate change. Many firms in this industry have operations in regions of the world that are facing water scarcity. Without careful planning, companies could face increased costs or, worse, lose access to water in these regions, thereby presenting a risk to production. Having rigorous checks in place to ensure a steady supply of water to all factories, as well as investing in technology to increase the efficiency of water use, will help firms in this industry keep a lower risk profile as water scarcity becomes a more pressing global issue.\n\n## Metrics\n\nCG-HP-140a.1. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources.\n\n   1.1 Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities.\n\n2 The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources.\n\n   2.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n   2.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.\n\n   3.1 Water consumption is defined as:\n\n      3.1.1 Water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge;\n\n      3.1.2 Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service;\n\n      3.1.3 Water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea."}
