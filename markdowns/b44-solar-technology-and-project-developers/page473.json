{"text_content": "# Energy Management in Manufacturing\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nSolar panel manufacturing typically uses electrical energy purchased from the grid. Energy can account for a considerable share of the total cost of production. In light of rising energy costs and regulatory uncertainty surrounding the future of fossil-based energy, companies that diversify their energy sources may be better able to manage the associated risks and maintain a reliable energy supply. Companies that minimize their energy use through effective energy management can reduce costs and gain a competitive advantage through operational efficiency and competitive pricing of products. This is particularly important given the intense price competition within the solar technology industry.\n\n## Metrics\n\nRR-ST-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable\n\n1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.\n\n1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.\n\n2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.\n\n3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.\n\n3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.", "page_number": 473}
