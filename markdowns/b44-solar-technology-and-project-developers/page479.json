In order to promote greater adoption of solar, the industry can benefit by preventing systemic disruptions to the existing energy infrastructure and essential energy services. Companies are innovating to overcome the technical challenges of increasing solar integration with the grid. They are also engaging with regulatory agencies and policymakers to reduce regulatory barriers to the adoption of solar energy, many of which are emerging due to the concern around increasing overall grid electricity costs and grid disruptions. Solar companies are investing in innovative technologies to reduce hardware and installation costs, and are working toward business-model innovation to reduce the cost of capital and facilitate the purchase of solar energy systems. Solar technology companies can improve their competitiveness through deploying one or more of these strategies successfully to ensure their ability to scale over the long term.\n\n## Metrics\n\nRR-ST-410a.1. Description of risks associated with integration of solar energy into existing energy infrastructure and discussion of efforts to manage those risks\n\n1 The entity shall describe risks, challenges, and barriers surrounding the integration of solar energy into the existing energy infrastructure in terms of its products and services.\n\n1.1 Relevant information to provide may include, but is not limited to:\n\n1.1.1 Technological barriers to increased integration of solar energy, such as limited transmission network connectivity, lack of access to high-capacity transmission networks, variability in interconnection standards, and inverter interconnection requirements;\n\n1.1.2 Operational barriers to increased integration of solar energy, such as curtailment and challenges associated with the variable nature of solar energy; and\n\n1.1.3 Customer motivations for seeking increased integration of solar energy, such as economic advantages, regulatory compliance, risk mitigation, and public perception or reputational risk.\n\n2 The entity shall discuss its strategy and approach to design, development, and sales in order to integrate solar energy into the existing energy infrastructure.\n\n2.1 Relevant strategies and approaches may include, but are not limited to:\n\n2.1.1 Technical product design;\n\n2.1.2 Development of new products or product components (e.g., smart inverters);"}
