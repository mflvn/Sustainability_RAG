# Industry Description

The Solar Technology & Project Developers industry comprises companies that manufacture solar energy equipment, including solar photovoltaic (PV) modules, polysilicon feedstock, solar thermal electricity-generation systems, solar inverters, and other related components. Companies may also develop, build, and manage solar energy projects and offer financing or maintenance services to customers. Two primary technologies are utilized in the industry: PV and concentrated solar power (CSP). Within solar PV, there are two main technologies: crystalline silicon-based solar and thin-film solar, which includes panels made using copper indium gallium selenide and cadmium telluride. The primary markets for solar panels are residential, non-residential (commercial and industrial), and utility-scale projects. Companies in the industry operate globally.

# Energy Management in Manufacturing

## Topic Summary

Solar panel manufacturing typically uses electrical energy purchased from the grid. Energy can account for a considerable share of the total cost of production. In light of rising energy costs and regulatory uncertainty surrounding the future of fossil-based energy, companies that diversify their energy sources may be better able to manage the associated risks and maintain a reliable energy supply. Companies that minimize their energy use through effective energy management can reduce costs and gain a competitive advantage through operational efficiency and competitive pricing of products. This is particularly important given the intense price competition within the solar technology industry.

## Metrics

RR-ST-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable

1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.

2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

#### Page 474

3.3    The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity
consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable
energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power
purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy
certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy
Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that
explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs
are paired with grid electricity.

3.3.1  For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs
must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf
of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable
energy.

3.3.2  For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement
must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained
or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order
for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.3  The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of
the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of
renewable energy.

3.4    For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from
biomass sources is limited to the following:

3.4.2  Energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a
third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable
Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest
Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered
eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for
Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional
standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state
renewable portfolio standard.

4      The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under
this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and
conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data including electricity
from solar or wind energy).

# Water Management in Manufacturing

## Topic Summary

Solar photovoltaic panel manufacturing can be water-intensive, and ultra-pure water is a critical input in some processes. The manufacturing process can also generate wastewater, which must be treated before disposal or reuse, and can therefore result in operating costs and additional capital expenditures. Furthermore, depending on their location, solar equipment manufacturing facilities may be exposed to the risk of reduced water availability (scarcity) and related cost increases or operational disruptions. The use of local water resources is a risk that can generate tension with local water users, potentially disrupting manufacturing operations and adversely impacting brand value. To mitigate water supply and treatment risks, companies can adopt various strategies such as recycling process water, improving production techniques to lower water intensity, and improving water treatment systems.

## Metrics

RR-ST-140a.1. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

# Management of Energy Infrastructure Integration & Related Regulations

## Topic Summary

Companies in the industry have faced challenges in establishing solar energy as a cost-competitive means of energy production and GHG reduction, and have thus encountered difficulty in capturing a greater share of global energy generation. In order to promote greater adoption of solar, the industry can benefit by preventing systemic disruptions to the existing energy infrastructure and essential energy services. Companies are innovating to overcome the technical challenges of increasing solar integration with the grid. They are also engaging with regulatory agencies and policymakers to reduce regulatory barriers to the adoption of solar energy, many of which are emerging due to the concern around increasing overall grid electricity costs and grid disruptions. Solar companies are investing in innovative technologies to reduce hardware and installation costs, and are working toward business-model innovation to reduce the cost of capital and facilitate the purchase of solar energy systems. Solar technology companies can improve their competitiveness through deploying one or more of these strategies successfully to ensure their ability to scale over the long term.
