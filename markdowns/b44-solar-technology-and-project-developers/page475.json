The manufacturing process can also generate wastewater, which must be treated before disposal or reuse, and can therefore result in operating costs and additional capital expenditures. Furthermore, depending on their location, solar equipment manufacturing facilities may be exposed to the risk of reduced water availability (scarcity) and related cost increases or operational disruptions. The use of local water resources is a risk that can generate tension with local water users, potentially disrupting manufacturing operations and adversely impacting brand value. To mitigate water supply and treatment risks, companies can adopt various strategies such as recycling process water, improving production techniques to lower water intensity, and improving water treatment systems.\n\n## Metrics\n\nRR-ST-140a.1. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources.\n\n1.1 Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities.\n\n2 The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources.\n\n2.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n2.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.\n\n3.1 Water consumption is defined as:\n\n3.1.1 Water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge;\n\n3.1.2 Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service;\n\n3.1.3 Water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea."}
