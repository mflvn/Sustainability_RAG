{"page_number": 471, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Solar Technology & Project Developers industry comprises companies that manufacture solar energy equipment, including solar photovoltaic (PV) modules, polysilicon feedstock, solar thermal electricity-generation systems, solar inverters, and other related components. Companies may also develop, build, and manage solar energy projects and offer financing or maintenance services to customers. Two primary technologies are utilized in the industry: PV and concentrated solar power (CSP). Within solar PV, there are two main technologies: crystalline silicon-based solar and thin-film solar, which includes panels made using copper indium gallium selenide and cadmium telluride. The primary markets for solar panels are residential, non-residential (commercial and industrial), and utility-scale projects. Companies in the industry operate globally.\n\n---\n\n75 Note to RR-ST-000.A \u2013 PV solar modules are defined in accordance with the U.S. DOE Solar Energy Glossary: photovoltaic (PV) module."}
