{"page_number": 598, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Airlines industry is comprised of companies that provide air transportation globally to passengers for both leisure and business purposes. This includes commercial full-service, low-cost, and regional airlines. Full-service carriers typically use a hub-and-spoke model to design their routes within countries and internationally. Low-cost carriers usually offer a smaller number of routes as well as no-frills service to their customers. Regional carriers typically operate under contract to full-service carriers, expanding the network of the larger carriers. Many airline companies also have a cargo segment in their operations from which they generate additional revenue. It is common within the industry for companies to form partnerships or join alliances in order to increase network size. Operating as an alliance allows airlines to offer customers access to international or otherwise underserved itineraries on multiple airlines under one ticket. At the same time, airlines share some overhead costs and increase their competitive position in the global market without having to operate outside their home country.\n\n---\n\n112 Note to TR-AL-000.A \u2013 Available seat kilometers (ASK) is defined as the maximum potential cumulative kilometers traveled by passengers (i.e., kilometers traveled by occupied and unoccupied seats).\n\n113 Note to TR-AL-000.B \u2013 Load factor is a measure of capacity utilization and is calculated as passenger kilometers traveled divided by available seat kilometers.\n\n114 Note to TR-AL-000.C \u2013 Revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) is defined as the cumulative total kilometers traveled by revenue passengers.
