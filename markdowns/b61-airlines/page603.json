{"text_content": "1.2 Acceptable calculation methodologies for fuel consumed include, but are\nnot limited to, methodologies based on:\n\n1.2.1 Adding fuel purchases made during the reporting period to\nbeginning inventory at the start of the reporting period, less any\nfuel inventory at the end of the reporting period\n\n1.2.2 Tracking fuel consumed by vehicles\n\n1.2.3 Tracking fuel expenses\n\n2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of fuel consumption that is alternative\nfuel.\n\n2.1 Alternative fuel is defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization\n(ICAO) as fuel from sources other than petroleum that has the potential to\ngenerate lower carbon emissions than petroleum-based fuel on a life cycle\nbasis.\n\n2.2 The percentage shall be calculated as the amount of alternative fuel\nconsumed (in GJ) divided by the total amount of fuel consumed (in GJ).\n\n3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of fuel consumed that is sustainable\nfuel.\n\n3.1 Sustainable fuel is defined as a subset of alternative fuel that meets all of\nthe following criteria described by ICAO:\n\n3.1.1 Achieves net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction on a life\ncycle basis;\n\n3.1.2 Avoids competition with food and water through utilization of\nmarginal or unviable land; and\n\n3.1.3 Contributes to local social and economic development, such as\nthrough expanded employment and revitalized infrastructure.\n\n3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as the amount of sustainable fuel\nconsumed (in GJ) divided by the total amount of fuel consumed (in GJ).\n\n4 The scope of disclosure is limited to fuel directly consumed by the entity. In\ncalculating energy consumption from fuels, the entity shall use higher heating\nvalues (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly\nmeasured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy, or the U.S. Energy Information Agency.\n\n5 The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under\nthis disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels).", "page_number": 603}
