The industry is thus subject to compliance costs and risks associated with climate change mitigation policies. The main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for airlines companies are aircraft fuel use and emissions, ground equipment, and facility electricity. Aircraft fuel use is the largest contributor to total emissions from the industry, and fuel management is a critical part of reducing emissions. Management of the environmental impacts of fuel usage includes increasing fuel efficiency through fleet upgrades, retrofits, and optimization of flight speed and route design as well as and incorporating alternative and sustainable fuels. These initiatives require capital expenditures, but in the long-run can reduce fuel costs and decrease a company's exposure to the risks of GHG emissions programs and regulations.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### TR-AL-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions\n\n1 The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083).\n\n1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\u2082-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).\n\n1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.\n\n2 Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).\n\n2.1 Acceptable calculation methodologies include those that conform to the GHG Protocol as the base reference, but provide additional guidance, such as industry- or region-specific guidance. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n2.1.1 GHG Reporting Guidance for the Aerospace Industry published by International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG)"}
