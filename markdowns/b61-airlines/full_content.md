# Industry Description

The Airlines industry is comprised of companies that provide air transportation globally to passengers for both leisure and business purposes. This includes commercial full-service, low-cost, and regional airlines. Full-service carriers typically use a hub-and-spoke model to design their routes within countries and internationally. Low-cost carriers usually offer a smaller number of routes as well as no-frills service to their customers. Regional carriers typically operate under contract to full-service carriers, expanding the network of the larger carriers. Many airline companies also have a cargo segment in their operations from which they generate additional revenue. It is common within the industry for companies to form partnerships or join alliances in order to increase network size. Operating as an alliance allows airlines to offer customers access to international or otherwise underserved itineraries on multiple airlines under one ticket. At the same time, airlines share some overhead costs and increase their competitive position in the global market without having to operate outside their home country.

112 Note to TR-AL-000.A – Available seat kilometers (ASK) is defined as the maximum potential cumulative kilometers traveled by passengers (i.e., kilometers traveled by occupied and unoccupied seats).

113 Note to TR-AL-000.B – Load factor is a measure of capacity utilization and is calculated as passenger kilometers traveled divided by available seat kilometers.

114 Note to TR-AL-000.C – Revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) is defined as the cumulative total kilometers traveled by revenue passengers. A revenue passenger is passenger for whose transportation an air carrier receives commercial remuneration.

[115] Note to TR-AL-000.D – Revenue ton kilometers (RTK) is defined as one metric ton of revenue traffic transported one kilometer. RTK is computed by multiplying the aircraft kilometers flown on each flight stage by the number of metric tons of revenue traffic carried on that flight stage (e.g., passengers, baggage, freight, and mail).

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

As a result of its heavy reliance on hydrocarbon fuels, the Airlines industry generates a significant amount of emissions, over 99 percent of which are in the form of carbon dioxide (CO₂). The industry is thus subject to compliance costs and risks associated with climate change mitigation policies. The main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for airlines companies are aircraft fuel use and emissions, ground equipment, and facility electricity. Aircraft fuel use is the largest contributor to total emissions from the industry, and fuel management is a critical part of reducing emissions. Management of the environmental impacts of fuel usage includes increasing fuel efficiency through fleet upgrades, retrofits, and optimization of flight speed and route design as well as and incorporating alternative and sustainable fuels. These initiatives require capital expenditures, but in the long-run can reduce fuel costs and decrease a company's exposure to the risks of GHG emissions programs and regulations.

## Metrics

### TR-AL-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions

1 The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol—carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃).

1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).

1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.

2 Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).

2.1 Acceptable calculation methodologies include those that conform to the GHG Protocol as the base reference, but provide additional guidance, such as industry- or region-specific guidance. Examples include, but are not limited to:

2.1.1 GHG Reporting Guidance for the Aerospace Industry published by International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG)

#### Page 601

2.1.2 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidance: Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

2.2 GHG emissions data shall be consolidated and disclosed according to the approach with which the entity consolidates its financial reporting data, which is generally aligned with the "financial control" approach defined by the GHG Protocol, and the approach published by the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) described in REQ-07, "Organisational boundary," of the CDSB Framework for reporting environmental information, natural capital and associated business impacts (April 2018).

3 The entity may discuss any change in its emissions from the previous reporting period, including whether the change was due to emissions reductions, divestment, acquisition, mergers, changes in output, and/or changes in calculation methodology.

4 In the case that current reporting of GHG emissions to the CDP or other entity (e.g., a national regulatory disclosure program) differs in terms of the scope and consolidation approach used, the entity may disclose those emissions. However, primary disclosure shall be according to the guidelines described above.

5 The entity may discuss the calculation methodology for its emissions disclosure, such as if data are from continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS), engineering calculations, or mass balance calculations.

TR-AL-110a.2. Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets

1 The entity shall discuss its long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage its Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

1.1 Scope 1 emissions are defined according to The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).
