{"page_number": 636, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Road Transportation industry consists of companies that provide long- and short-haul freight trucking services. Key activities include the shipment of containerized and bulk freight, including consumer goods and a wide variety of commodities. The industry is commonly broken down into two categories: truckload (vehicles carrying the goods of only one customer) and less-than-truckload (vehicles carrying the goods of multiple customers). Owner-operators comprise the vast majority of the industry due to the relative ease of entry, while a few large operators maintain market share through contracts with major shippers. Large companies often subcontract with owner-operators to supplement their owned fleet.\n\n---\n\n129 Note to TR-RO-000.A \u2013 A revenue ton mile (RTM) is defined as one ton of revenue traffic transported one mile. Revenue ton-miles are computed by multiplying the miles traveled on each leg by the number of tons of revenue traffic carried on that leg.\n\n130 Note to TR-RO-000.B \u2013 Load factor is a measure of capacity utilization and is calculated as cargo miles traveled divided by total miles traveled."}
