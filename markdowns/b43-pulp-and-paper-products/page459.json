In most facilities, energy is derived primarily from the combustion of biomass and fossil fuels, while purchased electricity may also be used in some facilities. Decisions regarding the generation of electricity on-site versus sourcing it from the grid, as well as the use of biomass and other renewable energy, can create trade-offs related to the energy supply's cost and reliability for operations and the extent of the regulatory risk from Scope 1 or other air emissions. The manner in which a company manages its energy efficiency, its reliance on different types of energy and the associated sustainability risks, and its ability to access alternative energy sources is likely to mitigate impacts of energy cost variability.\n\n## Metrics\n\nRR-PP-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage from biomass, (4) percentage from other renewable energy, (5) total self-generated energy\n\n1. The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n   1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n   1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.\n\n   1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n2. The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.\n\n   2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3. The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied by biomass.\n\n   3.1 The percentage shall be calculated as biomass energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n4. For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from biomass sources is limited to the following:\n\n   4.1 Energy from biomass sources that meets at least one of the following criteria:"}
