Companies in the industry typically function as business-to-business entities and may have operations in multiple countries, such as the U.S., Canada, and Brazil. While some integrated companies own or manage timber tracts and are engaged in forest management, sustainability issues arising from these activities are addressed in SASB's Forestry Management (RR-FM) industry standard."}
