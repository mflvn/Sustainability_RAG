Supply-chain risks include decreased productivity of forestlands due to management practices or climate change, regulations addressing sustainable forest management, and reputational impacts. To mitigate such risks and satisfy growing customer demand for sustainably sourced fiber and paper products, manufacturers implement forest certification and fiber chain-of-custody standards which verify that virgin and recycled fiber originate from sustainably managed forests. In addition, pulp and paper manufacturers face trade-offs from the use of recovered fiber. Products with recycled content are increasingly in demand , providing a possible avenue for product differentiation, while using recycled fiber can minimize the need for virgin fiber. Conversely, manufacturing products with a greater recycled content can increase waste generation and energy consumption, while recycled fiber can be costlier, given demand-supply gaps. Therefore, companies can benefit by optimizing recycled fiber use to balance its environmental and economic trade-offs.\n\n## Metrics\n\nRR-PP-430a.1. Percentage of wood fiber sourced from (1) third-party certified forestlands and percentage to each standard and (2) meeting other fiber sourcing standards and percentage to each standard\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of its total wood-fiber-based materials that have been sourced from forestlands that are certified to forest management standards, where:\n\n1.1 Third-party forest management standards are those that certify that forests are harvested in a sustainable manner and that cover environmental and social criteria including legal compliance, land rights, community and worker relations, environmental impact and biodiversity, forest management plans and practices, land use, wildlife habitat conservation, and water conservation, among others.\n\n1.2 Third-party forest management certifications include, but are not limited to, those promulgated by the following organizations (or the equivalent):\n\n1.2.1 American Tree Farm System (ATFS) (i.e., ATFS Certification)\n\n1.2.2 Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) (i.e., FSC Forest Management and Chain of Custody certifications)\n\n1.2.3 Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) (i.e., PEFC Chain of Custody certifications)\n\n1.2.4 Forest certification systems endorsed by the PEFC\n\n1.2.5 Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI) (i.e., SFI Forest Management and Chain of Custody certifications)"}
