{"text_content": "2.3 Pre-consumer material is defined as material that has been diverted from the waste stream during a manufacturing process. Excluded is reutilization of materials such as rework, regrind, or scrap that are generated in a process and are capable of being reclaimed within the same process that generated them.\n\n2.4 Post-consumer material is defined as material generated by households or by commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities in their role as end-users of a product that can no longer be used for its intended purpose. This includes returns of material from the distribution chain.\n\n2.5 Fiber shall be considered recycled or recovered if it meets the SFI definition of recycled content, the FSC definition of reclaimed material, or the PEFC definition of recycled wood and fibres.\n\nNote to RR-PP-430a.2\n\n1 The entity shall discuss its strategy to incorporate environmental lifecycle analyses into decisions to source recycled and recovered fiber versus virgin fiber.\n\n1.1 An environmental lifecycle tradeoff is defined as an environmental benefit or consequence of choosing to source one type of fiber over another.\n\n1.1.1 Environmental lifecycle benefits from using recycled and recovered fiber can include, but are not limited to, reducing the need for deforestation, reducing GHG emissions from paper in landfills, and reducing landfill waste.\n\n1.1.2 Environmental lifecycle consequences of using recycled and recovered fiber can include increased resource consumption and generation of air emissions during the transportation and processing of fiber.\n\n2 The entity shall discuss how lifecycle tradeoff assessments are incorporated into its fiber sourcing decisions, including how the following risks and opportunities are managed:\n\n2.1 Costs of recycled and recovered materials;\n\n2.2 Constraints related to accessing the necessary supply of recycled and recovered fiber;\n\n2.3 Recycling infrastructure needed by the entity or external paper collection facilities;\n\n2.4 Consumer behavior to improve recovery of paper for recycling;\n\n2.5 Virgin wood-fiber sourcing risks;\n\n2.6 Improving paper recovery rates;\n\n2.7 Regulation related to consumer recycling or minimum recycled content usage;\n\n2.8 Quality of fiber needed for products and the intended use of fiber for different product segments;", "page_number": 469}
