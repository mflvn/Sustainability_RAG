{"page_number": 543, "text_content": "# Climate Change Adaptation\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nHotels operating in climate change-exposed areas may be impacted by physical climate risks including inclement weather and flooding. Inclement weather may damage property and disrupt operations, thereby reducing asset values and revenues. In addition, hotels may face higher insurance premiums for buildings located in coastal regions or may be unable to insure their properties. Hotel operators will likely need to adapt to shifting climate trends such as rising sea levels, hurricanes, and flooding in order to maintain their climate-exposed revenue-generating properties.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### SV-HL-450a.1.
