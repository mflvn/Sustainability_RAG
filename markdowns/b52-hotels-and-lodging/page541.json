While water is not the industry's greatest operating cost, reduced water availability or significant price increases could impact financial results. This impact may be particularly acute in water-stressed region due to supply constraints. Companies in the industry are implementing water management best practices in order to reduce operating expenses and environmental impacts and improve to their reputations with guests, who are increasingly concerned about environmental sustainability.\n\n## Metrics\n\nSV-HL-140a.1. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources.\n\n1.1 Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities.\n\n2 The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources.\n\n2.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n2.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose the total amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.\n\n3.1 Water consumption is defined as:\n\n3.1.1 Water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge;\n\n3.1.2 Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service;\n\n3.1.3 Water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea.\n\n4 The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40-80 percent) or Extremely High (>80 percent) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct."}
