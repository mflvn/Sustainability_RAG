{"page_number": 540, "text_content": "3.3    The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity\n       consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable\n       energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power\n       purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy\n       certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy\n       Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that\n       explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs\n       are paired with grid electricity.\n\n       3.3.1   For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs\n               must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf\n               of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable\n               energy.\n\n       3.3.2   For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement\n               must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained\n               or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order\n               for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.\n\n       3.3.3   The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of\n               the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of\n               renewable energy.\n\n3.4    For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from\n       biomass sources is limited to the following:\n\n       3.4.2   Energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a\n               third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable\n               Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest\n               Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered\n               eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for\n               Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional\n               standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state\n               renewable portfolio standard.\n\n4      The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under\n       this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and\n       conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data, including electricity\n       from solar or wind energy)."}
