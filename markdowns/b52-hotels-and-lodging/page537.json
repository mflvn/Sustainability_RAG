{"page_number": 537, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Hotels & Lodging industry is composed of companies that provide overnight accommodation, including hotels, motels, and inns. It is a competitive industry that is primarily comprised of large hotel chains and in which customers base purchase decisions on a wide range of factors including quality and consistency of services, availability of locations, price, and loyalty program offers. Businesses are often structured in one or more of the following ways: direct revenue from hotel services, including room rental and food and beverage sales; management and franchise services with fee revenue from property management; and vacation residential ownership with revenue from sales of residential units.\n\nNote: Select companies in the Hotels & Lodging industry are also engaged in activities of the Restaurants industry. The SASB standards for such activities are outlined in the Restaurants industry standards. For the purposes of this standard, it is assumed that hotels and lodging companies do not provide food and beverage services, and therefore issues such as food safety, waste, and sourcing, which may be material for companies that offer food and beverages, are not covered by this industry standard.\n\n91 Note to SV-HL-000.B \u2013 Measured as number of (1) occupied room-nights divided by (2) available room-nights across all properties.\n92 Note to SV-HL-000.C \u2013 The scope includes facilities that were owned, operated, leased, or franchised during any portion of the reporting period."}
