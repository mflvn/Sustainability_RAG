{"text_content": "# Product Lifecycle Environmental Impacts\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nDepending on the specific building product or furnishing, significant environmental impacts can arise during raw material sourcing, transportation, manufacturing, use-phase, or end-of-life. Rising consumer and regulatory preference for less-impactful products has spawned the development of more sustainable products, broadly termed \"green building materials.\" In addition, product lifecycle certification has arisen as a tool for companies and their customers to assess and improve a product's lifecycle impact. Certification programs typically address specific sustainability characteristics of a product category and include the use of closed-loop materials that help minimize a product's end-of-life environmental impacts and reduce the need for extracting or producing virgin materials. Through product innovation and design that facilitates end-of-life product recovery and the use of less-impactful materials, the adoption of product certification programs, and partnerships with customers, manufacturers of building products can achieve improvements in lifecycle impacts, reduce regulatory risk, meet growing customer demand, and realize cost savings.\n\n## Metrics\n\nCG-BF-410a.1. Description of efforts to manage product lifecycle impacts and meet demand for sustainable products\n\n1 The entity shall discuss its strategies to assess and manage the environmental impact of products throughout their lifecycle.\n\n1.1 Relevant strategies and efforts to assess product lifecycle impacts include the use of environmentally focused design principles, the use of sustainability performance standards, and the use of screening tools and sampling methods, among others, including the operational processes it employs for these assessments.\n\n1.2 Relevant strategies and efforts to manage product lifecycle impacts include changes in materials selection, assessment of upstream environmental impacts, changes in manufacturing (resource intensity), use of recycled materials, use of renewable materials, optimization of packaging, design for consolidated shipping, design of low-energy-consumption products, design for product take-back, and labeling for recycling, among others.\n\n2 The entity shall discuss factors that drive demand for its sustainable building and furnishings products, including green building certification programs, federal and state procurement criteria, demand from retailers, and/or retail consumer demand.\n\n3 The entity shall describe the scope of its efforts including to which product categories, business segments, and/or operating regions they relate.\n\n4 The entity may discuss its use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) in the context of its approach to reducing environmental impact and maximizing product resource efficiency.", "page_number": 18}
