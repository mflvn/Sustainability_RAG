Purchased electricity represents the largest share of energy consumption across the industry, while companies may also utilize fossil fuel energy on site. The price of conventional grid electricity and volatility of fossil fuel prices may increase as a result of evolving climate change regulations and new incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy, among other factors, while alternative energy sources become more cost-competitive. Decisions regarding energy sourcing and type, as well as the use of alternative energy, can create trade-offs related to the energy supply's cost and reliability for operations. As the industry operates on relatively narrow profit margins, reductions in energy consumption may have a significant influence on financial performance. The manner in which a company manages energy efficiency, its reliance on different types of energy and the associated sustainability risks, and its ability to access alternative energy sources is likely to impact financial performance.\n\n## Metrics\n\nCG-BF-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable\n\n1. The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n   1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n   1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.\n\n   1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n2. The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.\n\n   2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3. The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.\n\n   3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass."}
