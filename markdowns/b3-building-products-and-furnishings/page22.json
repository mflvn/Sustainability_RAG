Unsustainable production and harvesting of timber can result in adverse environmental and social impacts, including biodiversity loss and harm to the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities. Companies may inadvertently source wood from areas that are susceptible to unsustainable forestry practices. Reports of illegal logging, environmental pollution, or adverse impacts on communities can result in reputational repercussions that can damage a company's brand value, affecting demand for their products. In addition, regulations that address the importation of illegally produced wood can result in penalties and further damage to brand value. To mitigate these risks, companies are increasingly adopting third-party certifications that verify that wood is grown and harvested in a sustainable manner. Obtaining wood sourcing certifications can also provide companies with a potential growth channel, as they can satisfy customer demand for certified products.\n\n## Metrics\n\nCG-BF-430a.1. (1) Total weight of wood fiber materials purchased; (2) percentage from third-party certified forestlands, (3) percentage by standard, and (4) percentage certified to other wood fiber standards, (5) percentage by standard\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the total amount of wood fiber materials (in air-dried metric tons) it purchased during the reporting period.\n\n1.1 Wood fiber materials include wood-fiber-based raw materials, components, and semi-finished and finished goods.\n\n1.2 The scope of wood-fiber-based materials includes all inputs that are processed to be sold as finished goods, including recycled raw materials, virgin raw materials, and goods that will be consumed directly in the production process, excluding biomass for energy.\n\n1.3 If wood fiber comprises a portion of a material, component, or product, the entity shall include the portion in the total amount.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose the percentage of its total wood fiber materials purchased that have been sourced from forestlands that are certified to a third-party forest management standard.\n\n2.1 Third-party forest management standards are those that certify that forests are harvested in a sustainable manner and that cover environmental and social criteria including legal compliance, land rights, community and worker relations, environmental impact and biodiversity, forest management plans and practices, land use, wildlife habitat conservation, and water conservation, among others.\n\n2.2 Third-party forest management standards include, but are not limited to:\n\n2.2.1 American Tree Farm (ATF)\n\n2.2.2 Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) (Forest Management and Chain of Custody certifications)"}
