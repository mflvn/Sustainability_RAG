{"page_number": 109, "text_content": "# Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nThe midstream industry generates significant quantities of greenhouse gases and other air emissions from compressor engine exhausts, oil and condensate tank vents, natural gas processing, and fugitive emissions, in addition to emissions from mobile sources. GHG emissions contribute to climate change and create additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for midstream companies due to climate change mitigation policies. At the same time, the management of fugitive emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, has emerged as a major operational, reputational, and regulatory risk. Financial impacts on companies will vary depending on the specific location of operations and the prevailing emissions regulations, and include higher operating or capital expenditures and regulatory or legal penalties. Companies that capture and monetize, or cost-effectively reduce emissions by implementing innovative monitoring and mitigation efforts and fuel efficiency measures could enjoy several benefits. These companies have the opportunity to reduce regulatory risks and to realize operational efficiencies in an environment of increasing regulatory and public concerns about air quality and climate change.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-MD-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage methane, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations\n\n1 The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083).\n\n1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO\u2082-e), calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP factors is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).\n\n1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.\n\n2 Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition, March 2004 (hereafter, the \"GHG Protocol\"), provided by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).\n\n2.1 These emissions include direct emissions of GHGs from stationary or mobile sources; these sources include but are not limited to: equipment at well sites, production facilities, refineries, chemical plants, terminals, fixed site drilling rigs, office buildings, marine vessels transporting products, tank truck fleets, mobile drilling rigs, and moveable equipment at drilling and production facilities."}
