From reducing automobile emissions through materials optimization to improving the performance of building insulation, chemical industry products can enhance efficiency across a multitude of applications. Companies that develop cost-effective solutions to address customers' needs for improved efficiency can therefore benefit from increased revenues and market share, stronger competitive positioning, and enhanced brand value.\n\n## Metrics\n\nRT-CH-410a.1. Revenue from products designed for use-phase resource efficiency\n\n1 The entity shall disclose its total revenue from products that are designed to increase resource efficiency during their use-phase.\n\n1.1 Products designed to increase resource efficiency are defined as those that \u2014 through their use \u2014 can be shown to improve energy efficiency, eliminate or lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reduce raw materials consumption, increase product longevity, and/or reduce water consumption.\n\n1.2 The use-phase is defined as the course over which the entity's product is used by a customer or consumer as a final product and/or the course over which the entity's product is used by a customer or consumer to generate a final product (e.g., in a manufacturing or production process).\n\n2 A product shall be considered to have been designed to increase use-phase resource efficiency if documentation shows that the entity has tested, modeled, or otherwise established the increase to resource efficiency its product delivers during its use phase.\n\n2.1 The scope of disclosure includes products that eliminate emissions during the use-phase, the need for a raw material, or the need for a process component like water.\n\n2.2 The scope of disclosure includes products that impart an incremental improvement to resource efficiency, insofar as the entity can demonstrate that the improvement is meaningful, such as through alignment with the milestones set forth in Section 5, \"Key Sectors\" of the European Commission's Road Map to a Resource Efficient Europe and/or with EU Directive 2012/27/EU.\n\n2.3 The scope of disclosure excludes products that impart improved resource efficiency in an ancillary, indirect, or minimal way (e.g., a conventional product that is slightly lighter than the previous generation of the product)."}
