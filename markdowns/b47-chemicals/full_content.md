# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Chemical manufacturing generates direct (Scope 1) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in manufacturing and cogeneration processes, as well as process emissions from the chemical transformation of feedstocks. GHG emissions can create regulatory compliance costs or penalties and operating risks for chemicals companies. However, resulting financial impacts will vary depending on the magnitude of emissions and the prevailing emissions regulations. The industry may be subject to increasingly stringent regulations as nations seek to limit or reduce emissions. Companies that cost-effectively manage GHG emissions through greater energy efficiency, the use of alternative fuels, or manufacturing process advances may benefit from improved operating efficiency and reduced regulatory risk, among other financial benefits.

## Metrics

RT-CH-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations

1 The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol—carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃).

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Chemical manufacturing is typically energy-intensive, with energy used to power processing units, cogeneration plants, machinery, and non-manufacturing facilities. The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and energy management strategies depends on the type of products manufactured. Typically, fossil fuels including natural gas and natural gas liquids are the predominant form of non-feedstock energy used, while purchased electricity may also represent a significant share. Therefore, energy purchases can represent a significant share of production costs. A company's energy mix may include energy generated onsite, purchased grid electricity and fossil fuels, and renewable and alternative energy. Tradeoffs in the use of such energy sources include cost, reliability of supply, related water use and air emissions, and regulatory compliance and risk. As such, a company's energy intensity and energy sourcing decisions may affect its operating efficiency and risk profile over time.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Water is a critical input in chemicals production and is used primarily for cooling, steam generation, and feedstock processing. Long-term historic increases in water scarcity and cost, and expectations of continued increases—due to overconsumption and constrained supplies, resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution, and climate change— indicate the heightened importance of water management. Water scarcity can result in a higher risk of operational disruption for companies with water-intensive operations and can also increase water procurement costs and capital expenditures. Meanwhile, chemical manufacturing can generate process wastewater that must be treated before disposal. Non-compliance with water quality regulations may result in regulatory compliance and mitigation costs or legal expenses stemming from litigation. Reducing water use and consumption through increased efficiency and other water management strategies may lead to lower operating costs over time and may mitigate financial impacts of regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions of operations.

# Product Design for Use-phase Efficiency

## Topic Summary

As increasing resource scarcity and regulations drive the need for greater materials efficiency and lower energy consumption and emissions, the Chemicals industry stands to benefit from developing products that enhance customer efficiency. From reducing automobile emissions through materials optimization to improving the performance of building insulation, chemical industry products can enhance efficiency across a multitude of applications. Companies that develop cost-effective solutions to address customers' needs for improved efficiency can therefore benefit from increased revenues and market share, stronger competitive positioning, and enhanced brand value.
