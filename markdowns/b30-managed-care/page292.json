Companies also provide administrative services and network access for self-funded insurance plans and manage pharmacy benefits. Enrollment in managed care has traditionally been correlated with employment rates, while revenues are driven by the inflation of medical costs. Legislative uncertainty and a focus on reducing health care costs may create downward pricing pressure and continue to drive consolidation within the industry. In addition, a focus on patient outcomes and plan performance continue to shape the industry's sustainability risks and opportunities."}
