## Industry Description

The Managed Care industry offers health insurance products for individual, commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid members. Companies also provide administrative services and network access for self-funded insurance plans and manage pharmacy benefits. Enrollment in managed care has traditionally been correlated with employment rates, while revenues are driven by the inflation of medical costs. Legislative uncertainty and a focus on reducing health care costs may create downward pricing pressure and continue to drive consolidation within the industry. In addition, a focus on patient outcomes and plan performance continue to shape the industry's sustainability risks and opportunities.

# Climate Change Impacts on Human Health

## Topic Summary

An increase in extreme weather events associated with climate change could have significant health impacts. These events, coupled with the potential spread of infectious diseases and food and water scarcity, are likely to present material implications for the Managed Care industry through an increase in encounters with the health care system. Companies that are able to address the risks posed by extreme weather events and potential changes in the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of illnesses and diseases may be better positioned to protect shareholder value.
