{"text_content": "# Fuel Economy & Emissions in Use-phase\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nMany of the Industrial Machinery & Goods industry's products are powered by fossil fuels and therefore release greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other air emissions during use. Customer preferences for improved fuel economy combined with regulations addressing emissions are increasing the demand for energy-efficient and lower-emission products in the industry. As such, companies that develop products with these characteristics may be well-positioned to capture expanding market share, reduce regulatory risk, and improve brand value.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### RT-IG-410a.1. Sales-weighted fleet fuel efficiency for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles\n\n1. The entity shall disclose its sales-weighted average fleet fuel efficiency for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, where:\n\n   1.1 Fleet fuel efficiency is defined as the average fuel economy of its medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, weighted by the number of each sold during the reporting period and measured in gallons per 1,000 ton-miles.\n\n   1.2 The scope of disclosure includes combination tractors (commonly known as semi-trucks or lorries), heavy duty heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, and vocational vehicles.\n\n   1.3 The scope of disclosure includes vehicles in the fleet that weigh a minimum of 3.5 metric tons or 8,500 pounds.\n\n   1.4 Where fleet averages are calculated by model year for regulatory purposes, the entity shall use these performance data.\n\n   1.5 In the absence of regulatory guidance on calculating a fleet average, the entity shall calculate performance based on the fuel economy of vehicles sold during the reporting period, weighted by sales volume.\n\n2. The entity shall disclose the sales-weighted fuel efficiency requirement for its medium- and heavy-duty vehicles pursuant to the entity's jurisdictional heavy-duty vehicle fuel emissions standards or regulations.\n\n3. If the entity operates in more than one jurisdiction, the entity shall disclose the standard or regulation used to determine if a fuel is renewable.\n\n### RT-IG-410a.2. Sales-weighted fuel efficiency for non-road equipment\n\n1. The entity shall disclose its sales-weighted average fuel efficiency for its non-road equipment and vehicles, where:", "page_number": 531}
