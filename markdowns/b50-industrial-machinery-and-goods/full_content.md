# Industry Description

The Industrial Machinery & Goods industry manufactures equipment for a variety of industries including construction, agriculture, energy, utility, mining, manufacturing, automotive, and transportation. Products include engines, earth-moving equipment, trucks, tractors, ships, industrial pumps, locomotives, and turbines. Machinery manufacturers utilize large amounts of raw materials for production, including steel, plastics, rubber, paints, and glass. Manufacturers may also perform the machining and casting of parts before final assembly. Demand in the industry is closely tied to industrial production, while government emissions standards and customer demand are driving innovations to improve energy efficiency and limit air emissions during product use.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Energy is a critical input in industrial machinery manufacturing. Purchased electricity represents the largest share of energy expenditures in the industry, followed by purchased fuels. The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and energy management strategies depends on the type of products manufactured. A company's energy mix, including the use of electricity generated on-site, grid-sourced electricity, and the use of alternative energy, can play an important role in influencing the cost and reliability of energy supply, and ultimately affect the company's cost structure and regulatory risk.

## Metrics

RT-IG-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable

1. The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

   1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

   1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

   1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2. The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.

   2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3. The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

   3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

   3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

#### Page 530

3.3 The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity.

3.3.1 For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.2 For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.3 The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of renewable energy.

3.4 For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from biomass sources is limited to the following:

3.4.2 Energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state renewable portfolio standard.

4 The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data including electricity from solar or wind energy).

# Fuel Economy & Emissions in Use-phase

## Topic Summary

Many of the Industrial Machinery & Goods industry's products are powered by fossil fuels and therefore release greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other air emissions during use. Customer preferences for improved fuel economy combined with regulations addressing emissions are increasing the demand for energy-efficient and lower-emission products in the industry. As such, companies that develop products with these characteristics may be well-positioned to capture expanding market share, reduce regulatory risk, and improve brand value.

## Metrics

### RT-IG-410a.1. Sales-weighted fleet fuel efficiency for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles

1. The entity shall disclose its sales-weighted average fleet fuel efficiency for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, where:

   1.1 Fleet fuel efficiency is defined as the average fuel economy of its medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, weighted by the number of each sold during the reporting period and measured in gallons per 1,000 ton-miles.

   1.2 The scope of disclosure includes combination tractors (commonly known as semi-trucks or lorries), heavy duty heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, and vocational vehicles.

   1.3 The scope of disclosure includes vehicles in the fleet that weigh a minimum of 3.5 metric tons or 8,500 pounds.

   1.4 Where fleet averages are calculated by model year for regulatory purposes, the entity shall use these performance data.

   1.5 In the absence of regulatory guidance on calculating a fleet average, the entity shall calculate performance based on the fuel economy of vehicles sold during the reporting period, weighted by sales volume.

2. The entity shall disclose the sales-weighted fuel efficiency requirement for its medium- and heavy-duty vehicles pursuant to the entity's jurisdictional heavy-duty vehicle fuel emissions standards or regulations.
