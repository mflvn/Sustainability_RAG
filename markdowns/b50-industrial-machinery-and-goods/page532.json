{"page_number": 532, "text_content": "1.1 Fuel efficiency is defined as the average fuel economy of its non-road equipment, weighted by the number of each unit sold during the reporting period and measured in gallons of fuel consumed per hour of operation (gallons per hour).\n\n1.1.1 In calculating gallons per hour, the entity shall use the model-rated fuel efficiency value for each piece of equipment where available.\n\n1.1.2 Where model-rated fuel efficiency values are not available, the entity shall calculate a gallons-per-hour operational efficiency for the equipment, assuming normal, reasonable operating conditions (e.g., for load factor, speed, and environmental conditions).\n\n1.2 Non-road equipment includes, but is not limited to, excavators and other construction equipment, farm tractors and other agricultural equipment, heavy forklifts, airport ground service equipment, and utility equipment such as generators, pumps, and compressors.\n\nRT-IG-410a.3. Sales-weighted fuel efficiency for stationary generators\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the sales-weighted average fuel efficiency of its stationary generators, where:\n\n1.1 Sales-weighted fuel efficiency is the average fuel efficiency of stationary generators sold during the reporting period, measured in watts per gallon.\n\n2 Sales-weighted fuel efficiency is calculated as the harmonic mean of design fuel efficiency in watts per gallon, where:\n\n2.1 The harmonic mean captures the average amount of fuel needed by each generator to produce a given amount of power.\n\n2.2 The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the average of the reciprocal values.\n\nRT-IG-410a.4. Sales-weighted emissions of: (1) nitrogen oxides (NOx) and (2) particulate matter (PM) for: (a) marine diesel engines, (b) locomotive diesel engines, (c) on-road medium- and heavy-duty engines, and (d) other non-road diesel engines\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the sales-weighted average emissions of (1) nitrogen oxides (NOx) and (2) particulate matter (PM) for each of the following product categories: (a) marine diesel engines, (b) locomotive diesel engines, (c) on-road medium- and heavy-duty engines, and (d) other non-road diesel engines, where:\n\n1.1 Emissions are calculated as the average emissions of (1) NOx and (2) PM for engines, weighted by the number of each sold during the reporting period and measured in grams per kilowatt hour.\n\n1.2 Marine diesel engines, locomotive diesel engines, on-road medium- and heavy-duty engines, and other non-road diesel engines shall be defined based on the applicable jurisdictional standard, guideline, or regulation."}
