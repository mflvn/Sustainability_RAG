{"page_number": 588, "text_content": "# Managing Systemic Risks from Technology Disruptions\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nGiven the systemic importance of telecommunications networks, systemic or economy-wide disruption may be created if the network infrastructure of telecommunication services companies is unreliable and prone to business continuity risks. As the frequency of extreme weather events associated with climate change increases, telecommunication services companies will face growing physical threats to network infrastructure, with potentially significant social or systemic impacts. In the absence of resilient and reliable infrastructure, companies may face lost revenue associated with service outages and unplanned capital expenditures to repair damaged or compromised equipment. Companies that successfully implement measures to address business continuity risks, including an identification of critical business operations, or to enhance resilience of the system are likely to substantially reduce their risk exposure and, hence, lower their cost of capital. While implementation of such measures may have upfront costs, companies are likely to see long-term benefits in terms of lower remediation expenses in cases of high-impact disruptions.\n\n## Metrics\n\nTC-TL-550a.2. Discussion of systems to provide unimpeded service during service interruptions\n\n1    The entity shall discuss business continuity risks associated with technology disruptions affecting operations.\n\n1.1  Examples of disruptions include, but are not limited to, those caused by technical failures, programming errors, cyber attacks, weather events, or natural disasters at hosting facilities. .\n\n2    The entity shall discuss measures to address business continuity risks, including an identification of critical business operations and redundancies or other measures implemented to enhance resilience of the system or to reduce impact, including insurance against loss.\n\n3    The entity may discuss estimated amount of potential loss, probability of that loss, and the associated timeframe. These estimates may be based on insurance figures or other third-party or internal assessments of potential loss."}
