{"page_number": 584, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Telecommunication Services industry consists of wireless and wireline telecommunications companies, as well as companies that provide cable and satellite services. The wireless services segment provides direct communication through radio-based cellular networks and operates and maintains the associated switching and transmission facilities. The wireline segment provides local and long distance voice communication via the Public Switched Telephone Network. Wireline carriers also offer voice over internet protocol (VoIP) telephone, television, and broadband internet services over an expanding network of fiber optic cables. Cable providers distribute television programming from cable networks to subscribers. They typically also provide consumers with video services, high-speed internet service, and VoIP. These services are traditionally bundled into packages that provide subscribers with easier payment options than paying for each service separately. Satellite companies distribute TV programming through broadcasting satellites orbiting the Earth or through ground stations. Companies serve customers primarily in their domestic markets, although some companies operate in several countries.\n\n107 Note to TC-TL-000.A \u2013 Wireless subscribers are defined as those customers that contract with the entity for mobile services, which include cellular phone service and/or wireless data service.\n108 Note to TC-TL-000.B \u2013 Wireline subscribers are defined as those customers that contract with the entity for fixed line phone services.\n109 Note to TC-TL-000.C \u2013 Broadband subscribers are defined as those customers that contract with the entity for fixed line cable and internet services, which include WiFi connections."}
