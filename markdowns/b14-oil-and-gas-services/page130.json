{"page_number": 130, "text_content": "# Water Management Services\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nOil and gas development often requires large quantities of water, exposing producers to the risk of reduced water availability, regulations limiting usage, or related cost increases, particularly in water-stressed regions. Producers also face risks and costs associated with wastewater disposal. As such, companies that provide these oil and gas producers with services have developed technologies and processes such as closed-loop water recycling systems to reduce customers' water consumption and disposal costs. These offerings provide service companies the potential to gain market share and increase revenues, as management of drilling and wastewater can be a significant competitive factor for their customers.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-SV-140a.1. (1) Total volume of fresh water handled in operations, (2) percentage recycled\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the volume of fresh water, in thousands of cubic meters, handled in operations.\n\n1.1 Handled water includes that which is transferred to the entity from a third party for the purpose of providing the entity's contractual scope of service as well as that which is directly obtained and used by the entity in its operations.\n\n1.2 Fresh water may be defined according to the local statutes and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no regulatory definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n1.3 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose the percentage of water recycled as the volume recycled divided by the volume of fresh water handled.\n\n3 Recycled water shall include the amount recycled in closed-loop and open-loop systems as well as recycled produced water or flowback.\n\n3.1 Any volume of water reused multiple times shall be counted as recycled each time it is recycled and reused.\n\n4 Produced water is defined as water (brine) brought up from the hydrocarbon bearing formation strata during the extraction of oil and gas and can include formation water, injection water, and any chemicals added downhole or during the oil/water separation process.\n\n5 Flowback is defined as the process of allowing fluids (including water) and entrained solids to flow from a well following a treatment, either in preparation for a subsequent phase of treatment or in preparation for cleanup and returning the well to production."}
