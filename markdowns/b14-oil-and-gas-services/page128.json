{"page_number": 128, "text_content": "2 The entity shall discuss its short-term and long- term plans related to air quality management, where:\n\n2.1 Short-term strategies may include fuel substitution (e.g., drop-in biodiesel), use of dual fuel equipment, or engine maintenance.\n\n2.2 Long-term strategies may include alternative fuel equipment, process, or equipment redesigns and innovations, carbon capture, and storage.\n\n3 The scope of disclosure shall include, but is not limited to emissions from the following specific sources:\n\n3.1 Combustion emissions (e.g., fuel use in gas compression, power generation).\n\n3.2 Flaring of hydrocarbons (e.g., in depressurizing, start-up/shut-down, well testing and well work-over).\n\n3.3 Process emissions (e.g., vessel loading, tank storage, and flushing).\n\n3.4 Venting of hydrocarbons, defined as the intentional (or designed), controlled release of gas to the atmosphere during normal operations.\n\n3.5 Fugitive emissions of greenhouse gases (including equipment leaks).\n\n3.6 Other non-routine events (e.g., gas releases or equipment maintenance).\n\n4 The entity shall discuss risks and opportunities it may face relating to its ability to offer its customers services, technologies, or solutions that enhance energy efficiency and reduce air emissions, including of greenhouse gases.\n\nEM-SV-110a.3. Percentage of engines in service that comply with highest level of emissions standards for non-road diesel engine emissions\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of its non-road diesel engines that are in compliance with the highest level of jurisdictional emissions standards.\n\n1.1 The scope of disclosure shall include new and in-use non-road diesel engines, including, but not limited to, those used in equipment, pumps, compressors, and generators.\n\n2 The entity shall calculate the percentage as the new and in-use number of non-road diesel engines that are in full compliance with the highest level of jurisdictional emissions standards during the reporting period, divided by the total number of non-road diesel engines active during the reporting period, where:\n\n2.1 An engine is considered in compliance with the standards if (1) it belongs to an engine family which has test results showing official emission results and deteriorated emission levels at or below these standards, and (2) the engine family has received confirmation from the certifying or regulatory body indicating alignment with the standard used."}
