{"text_content": "5.1 The term flowback also means the fluids and entrained solids that emerge from a well during the flowback process. The flowback period begins when material introduced into the well during the treatment returns to the surface following hydraulic fracturing or refracturing.\n\n5.2 The flowback period ends when either the well is shut in and permanently disconnected from the flowback equipment or at the startup of production.\n\n5.3 The flowback period includes the initial flowback stage and the separation flowback stage.\n\n6 The scope is limited to operations for which the entity provides hydraulic fracturing, completion, drilling, and/or water management services [e.g., water treatment for reuse in drilling or hydraulic fracturing, reduction of unwanted water in subsurface areas].\n\n6.1 The scope includes, but is not limited to, water that is used in hydraulic fracturing fluids, drilling fluids, dust control, and drilling cement production.\n\nEM-SV-140a.2. Discussion of strategy or plans to address water consumption and disposal-related risks, opportunities, and impacts\n\n1 The entity shall discuss its strategy or plans to address water consumption and disposal-related risks, opportunities, and impacts.\n\n1.1 The scope of disclosure shall include the entity's strategies, plans, and/or reduction activities, including whether they pertain differently to different business units, geographies, or water sources.\n\n1.2 The scope of disclosure includes the activities and investments by the entity that are required to achieve the plans and any risks or limiting factors that might affect achievement of the plans and/or targets.\n\n2 The entity shall discuss demand for specific products, services, and technologies that offer well and field operators reduced water consumption, water recycling, and/or other water impact reductions, and its ability to meet this demand.\n\n3 The entity shall discuss its short-term and long-term plans related to water management, where:\n\n3.1 Short-term strategies may include adopting best practices in water recycling or water efficiency initiatives.\n\n3.2 Long-term strategies may include process redesigns or technological innovations that lower withdrawal of fresh water in constrained regions, reduce excess water production from wells, provide new water treatment or recycling systems.\n\n4 The scope of impact reductions may relate to the following specific areas of water consumption or disposal:\n\n4.1 Hydraulic fracturing fluids", "page_number": 131}
