# Industry Description

Oil and gas services companies provide support services, manufacture equipment, or are contract drillers for oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) companies. The drilling and drilling-support segment comprises companies that drill for oil and natural gas on-shore and off-shore on a contract basis. Companies in this segment may also manufacture jack-up rigs, semisubmersible rigs, and drill ships. Companies in the oilfield services segment manufacture equipment that is used in the extraction, storage, and transportation of oil and natural gas. They also provide support services such as seismic surveying, equipment rental, well cementing, and well monitoring. These services are commonly provided on a contractual basis, and the customer will purchase or lease the materials and equipment from the service provider. Service companies may also provide personnel or subject matter expertise as part of their scope of service. The contractual relationship between oil and gas services companies and their customers plays a significant role in determining the material impacts of their sustainability performance. Besides the rates charged, companies compete on the basis of their operational and safety performance, technology and process offerings, and reputation.

# Emissions Reduction Services & Fuels Management

## Topic Summary

While direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and associated regulatory risks are relatively low for oil and gas services providers relative to other industries, emissions from the operations of their customers—the oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) companies—can be significant. Emissions include GHGs that can contribute to climate change as well as other air pollutants that can have significant localized human health and environmental impacts. Increasing regulation and high costs of fuels associated with these emissions present substantial risk to E&P companies. This is driving companies to seek ways to lower their emissions, including converting pumps and engines to run on natural gas instead of diesel fuel. Oil and gas services companies compete for contracts with E&P companies partly on the basis of providing cutting-edge, efficient technologies that can help customers reduce costs and improve process efficiencies. Services companies can gain a competitive advantage and protect their revenues and market share by providing customers with services and equipment that reduce the emissions and fuel consumption of E&P activities, and by capturing saleable gas that may otherwise be flared or escape through leaks.

# Water Management Services

## Topic Summary

Oil and gas development often requires large quantities of water, exposing producers to the risk of reduced water availability, regulations limiting usage, or related cost increases, particularly in water-stressed regions. Producers also face risks and costs associated with wastewater disposal. As such, companies that provide these oil and gas producers with services have developed technologies and processes such as closed-loop water recycling systems to reduce customers' water consumption and disposal costs. These offerings provide service companies the potential to gain market share and increase revenues, as management of drilling and wastewater can be a significant competitive factor for their customers.

## Metrics

EM-SV-140a.1. (1) Total volume of fresh water handled in operations, (2) percentage recycled

1 The entity shall disclose the volume of fresh water, in thousands of cubic meters, handled in operations.

1.1 Handled water includes that which is transferred to the entity from a third party for the purpose of providing the entity's contractual scope of service as well as that which is directly obtained and used by the entity in its operations.

1.2 Fresh water may be defined according to the local statutes and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no regulatory definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1000 parts per million of dissolved solids.

1.3 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.

2 The entity shall disclose the percentage of water recycled as the volume recycled divided by the volume of fresh water handled.

3 Recycled water shall include the amount recycled in closed-loop and open-loop systems as well as recycled produced water or flowback.

3.1 Any volume of water reused multiple times shall be counted as recycled each time it is recycled and reused.

4 Produced water is defined as water (brine) brought up from the hydrocarbon bearing formation strata during the extraction of oil and gas and can include formation water, injection water, and any chemicals added downhole or during the oil/water separation process.

5 Flowback is defined as the process of allowing fluids (including water) and entrained solids to flow from a well following a treatment, either in preparation for a subsequent phase of treatment or in preparation for cleanup and returning the well to production.

#### Page 131

5.1 The term flowback also means the fluids and entrained solids that emerge from a well during the flowback process. The flowback period begins when material introduced into the well during the treatment returns to the surface following hydraulic fracturing or refracturing.

5.2 The flowback period ends when either the well is shut in and permanently disconnected from the flowback equipment or at the startup of production.

5.3 The flowback period includes the initial flowback stage and the separation flowback stage.

6 The scope is limited to operations for which the entity provides hydraulic fracturing, completion, drilling, and/or water management services [e.g., water treatment for reuse in drilling or hydraulic fracturing, reduction of unwanted water in subsurface areas].

6.1 The scope includes, but is not limited to, water that is used in hydraulic fracturing fluids, drilling fluids, dust control, and drilling cement production.

EM-SV-140a.2. Discussion of strategy or plans to address water consumption and disposal-related risks, opportunities, and impacts

1 The entity shall discuss its strategy or plans to address water consumption and disposal-related risks, opportunities, and impacts.

1.1 The scope of disclosure shall include the entity's strategies, plans, and/or reduction activities, including whether they pertain differently to different business units, geographies, or water sources.

1.2 The scope of disclosure includes the activities and investments by the entity that are required to achieve the plans and any risks or limiting factors that might affect achievement of the plans and/or targets.

2 The entity shall discuss demand for specific products, services, and technologies that offer well and field operators reduced water consumption, water recycling, and/or other water impact reductions, and its ability to meet this demand.

3 The entity shall discuss its short-term and long-term plans related to water management, where:

3.1 Short-term strategies may include adopting best practices in water recycling or water efficiency initiatives.

3.2 Long-term strategies may include process redesigns or technological innovations that lower withdrawal of fresh water in constrained regions, reduce excess water production from wells, provide new water treatment or recycling systems.

4 The scope of impact reductions may relate to the following specific areas of water consumption or disposal:

4.1 Hydraulic fracturing fluids
