Emissions include GHGs that can contribute to climate change as well as other air pollutants that can have significant localized human health and environmental impacts. Increasing regulation and high costs of fuels associated with these emissions present substantial risk to E&P companies. This is driving companies to seek ways to lower their emissions, including converting pumps and engines to run on natural gas instead of diesel fuel. Oil and gas services companies compete for contracts with E&P companies partly on the basis of providing cutting-edge, efficient technologies that can help customers reduce costs and improve process efficiencies. Services companies can gain a competitive advantage and protect their revenues and market share by providing customers with services and equipment that reduce the emissions and fuel consumption of E&P activities, and by capturing saleable gas that may otherwise be flared or escape through leaks.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-SV-110a.1.
