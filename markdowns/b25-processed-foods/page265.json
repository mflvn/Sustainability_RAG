{"page_number": 265, "text_content": "# Environmental & Social Impacts of Ingredient Supply Chain\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nCompanies in the Processed Foods industry manage global supply chains to source a wide range of ingredient inputs. How companies screen, monitor, and engage with suppliers on environmental and social topics affects the ability of companies to maintain a steady supply and manage price fluctuations. Supply chain management issues related to labor and environmental practices, ethics, or corruption may also result in regulatory fines and/or increased long-term operational costs for companies. The consumer-facing nature of the industry increases the reputational risks associated with supplier performance. Companies can engage with key suppliers to manage environmental and social risks to improve supply chain resiliency, mitigate reputational risks, and potentially increase consumer demand or capture new market opportunities.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFB-PF-430a.1.
