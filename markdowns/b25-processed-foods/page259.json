Energy is needed to operate large manufacturing facilities for cooking, refrigeration, and packaging. Energy production and consumption contributes to significant environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution, which have the potential to indirectly, yet materially, impact the results of operations of processed foods companies. Energy efficiency in production and distribution can mitigate exposure to volatile energy costs and limit a company's contribution to direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Producers may be able to further reduce the risk posed by volatile fossil fuel energy costs\u2014particularly natural gas, which is used heavily in the industry\u2014by diversifying their energy portfolio across a range of sources. Decisions regarding the use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site generation of electricity versus purchasing from the grid, can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of the energy supply.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFB-PF-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable\n\n1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.\n\n1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.\n\n2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.\n\n3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass."}
