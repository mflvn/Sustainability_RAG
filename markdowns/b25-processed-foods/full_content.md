# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

The Processed Foods industry is highly reliant on energy and fuel as primary inputs for value creation in manufacturing food products. Energy is needed to operate large manufacturing facilities for cooking, refrigeration, and packaging. Energy production and consumption contributes to significant environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution, which have the potential to indirectly, yet materially, impact the results of operations of processed foods companies. Energy efficiency in production and distribution can mitigate exposure to volatile energy costs and limit a company's contribution to direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Producers may be able to further reduce the risk posed by volatile fossil fuel energy costs—particularly natural gas, which is used heavily in the industry—by diversifying their energy portfolio across a range of sources. Decisions regarding the use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site generation of electricity versus purchasing from the grid, can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of the energy supply.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Processed Foods companies rely on a large water supply for cooking, processing, and cleaning finished goods. Additionally, companies in the industry generate and must manage its wastewater discharge from processing activities. As water scarcity becomes an issue of increasing importance, processed foods companies—especially those operating in water-stressed regions—may face increasing operational risks. Companies in the industry may face higher operational costs as well as water shortages due to physical availability and/or regulations. Companies can manage water-related risks and opportunities through capital investments and assessment of facility locations relative to water scarcity risks, improvements to operational efficiency, and partnerships with regulators and communities on issues related to water access and effluent.

# Environmental & Social Impacts of Ingredient Supply Chain

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Processed Foods industry manage global supply chains to source a wide range of ingredient inputs. How companies screen, monitor, and engage with suppliers on environmental and social topics affects the ability of companies to maintain a steady supply and manage price fluctuations. Supply chain management issues related to labor and environmental practices, ethics, or corruption may also result in regulatory fines and/or increased long-term operational costs for companies. The consumer-facing nature of the industry increases the reputational risks associated with supplier performance. Companies can engage with key suppliers to manage environmental and social risks to improve supply chain resiliency, mitigate reputational risks, and potentially increase consumer demand or capture new market opportunities.

## Metrics

# Ingredient Sourcing

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Processed Foods industry source a wide range of ingredients, largely agricultural inputs, from global suppliers. The industry's ability to source ingredients and at certain price points fluctuates with supply availability, which may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management, and other resource scarcity considerations. This exposure can lead to price volatility which may affect company profitability. Climate change, water scarcity, and land-use restrictions present risks to a company's long-term ability to source key materials and ingredients. Companies that source ingredients which are more productive and less resource-intensive, or work closely with suppliers to increase their adaptability to climate change and other resource scarcity risks will be better protected from price volatility and/or supply disruptions.
