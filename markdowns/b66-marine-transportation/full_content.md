# Industry Description

The Marine Transportation industry consists of companies that provide deep-sea, coastal, and/or river-way freight shipping services. It is of strategic importance to international trade and its revenues are tied to macroeconomic cycles. Key activities include transportation of containerized and bulk freight, including consumer goods and a wide range of commodities, and transportation of chemicals and petroleum products in tankers. Due to the global scope of the industry, companies operate in many countries and under diverse legal and regulatory frameworks.

122 Note to TR-MT-000.A – Shipboard employees are those employees who work aboard the entity's vessels (including direct and contract employees) during the reporting period.
123 Note to TR-MT-000.C – Operating days are calculated as the number of available days in a reporting period minus the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to unforeseen circumstances (i.e., a measure of days in a reporting period during which vessels actually generate revenue).

#### Page 624

124 Note to TR-MT-000.D – Deadweight tonnage is the sum, for all of the entity's vessels, of the difference in displacement in deadweight tons between the light displacement and the actual loaded displacement.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Marine transportation companies generate emissions mainly from the combustion of diesel in ship engines. The industry's reliance on heavy fuel oil ("bunker fuel") is of material concern due to rising fuel costs and intensifying greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations. The industry is among the most fuel efficient of the major transportation modes in terms of fuel use per ton shipped. However, due to the size of the industry, its contribution to the global GHG inventory is still significant. Recent environmental regulations are driving the adoption of more fuel-efficient engines and the use of cleaner-burning fuels. Fuel constitutes a major expense for industry players, providing a further incentive for investing in upgrades or retrofits to boost fuel efficiency.

## Metrics

TR-MT-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions

1 The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol—carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃).

1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO₂-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).

1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.

2 Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).

2.1 Acceptable calculation methodologies include those that conform to the GHG Protocol as the base reference, but provide additional guidance, such as industry- or region-specific guidance. Examples include, but are not limited to:

2.1.1 GHG Reporting Guidance for the Aerospace Industry published by International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG)

2.1.2 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidance: Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

2.1.3 India GHG Inventory Program

2.1.4 ISO 14064-1

#### Page 626

2.1.5 Petroleum Industry Guidelines for reporting GHG emissions, 2nd edition, 2011, published by IPIECA

2.1.6 Protocol for the quantification of greenhouse gas emissions from waste management activities published by Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EpE)

2.2 GHG emissions data shall be consolidated and disclosed according to the approach with which the entity consolidates its financial reporting data, which is generally aligned with the "financial control" approach defined by the GHG Protocol, and the approach published by the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) described in REQ-07, "Organisational boundary," of the CDSB Framework for reporting environmental information, natural capital and associated business impacts (April 2018).

3 The entity may discuss any change in its emissions from the previous reporting period, including whether the change was due to emissions reductions, divestment, acquisition, mergers, changes in output, and/or changes in calculation methodology.

4 In the case that current reporting of GHG emissions to the CDP or other entity (e.g., a national regulatory disclosure program) differs in terms of the scope and consolidation approach used, the entity may disclose those emissions. However, primary disclosure shall be according to the guidelines described above.

5 The entity may discuss the calculation methodology for its emissions disclosure, such as if data are from continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS), engineering calculations, or mass balance calculations.

TR-MT-110a.2. Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets

#### Page 628

1.3    In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2    The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from heavy fuel oil.

2.1    Heavy fuel oils are defined as heavier oils that remain after distillate fuel oils and lighter hydrocarbons are distilled away in refinery operations.

2.2    The percentage shall be calculated as heavy fuel oil consumption divided by total energy consumption.
