{"page_number": 628, "text_content": "1.3    In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n2    The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from heavy fuel oil.\n\n2.1    Heavy fuel oils are defined as heavier oils that remain after distillate fuel oils and lighter hydrocarbons are distilled away in refinery operations.\n\n2.2    The percentage shall be calculated as heavy fuel oil consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3    The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.\n\n3.1    Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.\n\n3.2    The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3.3    The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green\u2010e Energy Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green\u2010e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity.\n\n3.3.1    For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.\n\n3.3.2    For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy."}
