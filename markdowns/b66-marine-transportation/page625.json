The industry's reliance on heavy fuel oil (\"bunker fuel\") is of material concern due to rising fuel costs and intensifying greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations. The industry is among the most fuel efficient of the major transportation modes in terms of fuel use per ton shipped. However, due to the size of the industry, its contribution to the global GHG inventory is still significant. Recent environmental regulations are driving the adoption of more fuel-efficient engines and the use of cleaner-burning fuels. Fuel constitutes a major expense for industry players, providing a further incentive for investing in upgrades or retrofits to boost fuel efficiency.\n\n## Metrics\n\nTR-MT-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions\n\n1 The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083).\n\n1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO\u2082-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).\n\n1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.\n\n2 Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).\n\n2.1 Acceptable calculation methodologies include those that conform to the GHG Protocol as the base reference, but provide additional guidance, such as industry- or region-specific guidance. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n2.1.1 GHG Reporting Guidance for the Aerospace Industry published by International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG)\n\n2.1.2 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidance: Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n\n2.1.3 India GHG Inventory Program\n\n2.1.4 ISO 14064-1"}
