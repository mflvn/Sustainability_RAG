Thermoelectric power plants\u2014typically coal, nuclear, and natural gas\u2014are dependent on large quantities of water for cooling purposes. The industry is facing increasing water-related supply and regulatory risks, potentially requiring capital investment in technology or even resulting in stranded assets. As water supplies tighten in many regions\u2014and electricity generation, agriculture, and community use compete for water supplies in the coming decade\u2014power plants may increasingly be unable to operate at their full capacity, or at all, because of region-specific water constraints. The availability of water is a key factor to consider when calculating the future value of many electricity-generating assets and for evaluating existing proposals for new generation sources. Heightened water scarcity\u2014due to factors such as increasing consumption and reduced supplies as a result of climate change, which could result in more frequent or intense droughts\u2014could prompt regulatory authorities to limit companies' ability to withdraw necessary amounts of water, especially in regions with high baseline water stress. Furthermore, companies must contend with the growing regulations related to the significant biodiversity impacts that such large withdrawals can cause. To mitigate risks, companies can both invest in more efficient water-usage systems for existing plants and place strategic priority on assessing long-term water availability, as well as water-related biodiversity risks, when siting new power plants.\n\n## Metrics\n\nIF-EU-140a.1. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources.\n\n1.1 Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities.\n\n2 The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources.\n\n2.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n2.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.\n\n3.1 Water consumption is defined as:"}
