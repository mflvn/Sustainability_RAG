These emissions, mainly carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, are mostly by-products of fossil fuels combustion. The transmission and/or distribution (T&D) segments of the industry are responsible for a negligible amount of its emissions. Electric utility companies could face significant operating and capital expenditures for mitigating GHG emissions as environmental regulations become increasingly stringent. While many of these costs can be passed on to a utility's customers, some power generators, especially in deregulated markets, may not be able to recoup these costs. Companies can reduce GHG emissions from electricity generation mainly through careful planning of their infrastructure investments to ensure an energy mix capable of meeting the emissions requirements set forth by regulations and by implementing industry-leading technologies and processes. Being proactive in cost-effectively reducing GHG emissions can create a competitive advantage for companies and mitigate unanticipated regulatory compliance costs. Failure to properly estimate capital-expenditure needs and permitting costs, or other difficulties in reducing GHG emissions, could result in significant negative impacts on returns in the future in the form of asset write-downs, costs of obtaining carbon credits, or unexpected increases in operating and capital expenditures. Regulatory emphasis on this issue will likely increase in the coming decades, as exemplified by the international emissions-reduction agreement made at the 21st session of the United Nations Conference of the Parties that took place in late 2015.\n\n## Metrics\n\nIF-EU-110a.1. (1) Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under (2) emissions-limiting regulations, and (3) emissions-reporting regulations\n\n1    The entity shall disclose its (1) gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol \u2014carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083).\n\n    1.1    Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO\u2082-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).\n\n    1.2    Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.\n\n2    Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD)."}
