{"page_number": 318, "text_content": "# Grid Resiliency\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nElectricity is critical for the continued function of most elements of modern life, from medicine to finance, creating a societal reliance on continuous service. There are potentially high societal costs from major disruptions to electricity infrastructure. Disruptions can be caused by extreme weather events, natural disasters, and cyber attacks. As the frequency and severity of extreme weather events associated with climate change continues to increase, all segments of electric utilities companies\u2014and especially major transmission and distribution (T&D) operations\u2014will face increasing physical threats to their infrastructure. This could result in frequent or significant service disruptions, outages, and the need to upgrade or repair damaged or compromised equipment, all of which may result in substantial costs and damaged perspectives of regulators and customers. The increased usage of smart grid technology has several benefits, including strengthening the resiliency of the grid to extreme weather events. However, this technology can make the grid more vulnerable to cyber attacks, as it provides hackers more entryways into infrastructure systems. Companies need to implement strategies that minimize the probability and magnitude of impacts from extreme weather events and cyber attacks. They can remain competitive in the face of increasing external competition by actively submitting compelling rate cases to improve the reliability, resilience, and quality of their infrastructure.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-EU-550a.1.
