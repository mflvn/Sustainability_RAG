{"page_number": 303, "text_content": "1.1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e), calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP factors is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).\n\n1.1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets or credits.\n\n2 GHG emissions associated with electric power delivered to retail customers are defined by and shall be calculated according to the methodology established by the numerator in \"EPS Metric D-3: Retail Electric Deliveries,\" contained in the Electric Power Sector Protocol for the Voluntary Reporting Program, June 2009, Version 1.0, provided by The Climate Registry, including 2010 Updates and Clarifications (which clarified that \"EPS Metric D-3: Retail Electric Deliveries\" was mislabeled as \"EPS Metric D-1\" in Version 1.0).\n\n2.1 These emissions are generally calculated as the sum of emissions from power generation facilities that are owned by the entity and those from power that was purchased from a third-party, subtracted by the emissions from power that was resold at the wholesale level.\n\n2.2 The scope of GHG emissions shall include all emissions associated from power delivered to retail customers, including emissions associated with power lost in transmission and distribution.\n\n2.3 Emissions factors for power purchased from third-parties are based on the most relevant and accurate method, which will depend on the type of power purchased. The Electric Power Sector Protocol for the Voluntary Reporting Program establishes potential methods.\n\n3 Disclosure corresponds to the numerator in the metric contained in the Electric Power Research Institute's 2018 Metrics to Benchmark Electric Power Company Sustainability Performance , \"Total CO2 emissions rate for power deliveries,\" with the exception of the scope of emissions including all seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nIF-EU-110a.3. Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets\n\n1 The entity shall discuss its long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage its Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\n1.1 Scope 1 emissions are defined according to The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD)."}
