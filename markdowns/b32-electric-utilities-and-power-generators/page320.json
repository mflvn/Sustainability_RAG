{"page_number": 320, "text_content": "4.1.1 The entity should collect values of daily SAIDI for five sequential years, ending on the last day of the last complete reporting period. If fewer than five years of historical data are available, use all of the available historical data.\n\n4.1.2 If any day in the data set has a value of zero for SAIDI, replace it with the lowest non-zero SAIDI value in the data set\u2014this permits taking the logarithm of every day.\n\n4.1.3 Take the natural logarithm (ln) of each daily SAIDI value in the data set.\n\n4.1.4 Find \u03b1 (Alpha), the average of the logarithms (also known as the logaverage) of the data set.\n\n4.1.5 Find \u03b2 (Beta), the standard deviation of the logarithms (also known as the log-average) of the data set.\n\n4.1.6 Compute the major event day threshold, T<sub>MED</sub>, using the equation:\n\nT<sub>MED</sub> = e<sup>(\u03b1+\u03b2)</sup>.\n\n4.1.7 Any day with daily SAIDI greater than the threshold value T<sub>MED</sub> that occurs during the subsequent reporting period is a major event day.\n\nNote to IF-EU-550a.2\n\n1 The entity shall discuss notable service disruptions such as those that affected a significant number of customers or disruptions of extended duration.\n\n2 For such disruptions, the entity should provide:\n\n2.1 Description and cause of the service disruption\n\n2.2 The total generation or transmission capacity, in megawatts, and population affected by the disruption\n\n2.3 The costs associated with the service disruption\n\n2.4 Actions taken to mitigate the potential for future service interruptions\n\n2.5 Any other significant outcomes (e.g., legal proceedings or related fatalities)"}
