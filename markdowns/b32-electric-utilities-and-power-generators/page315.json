While owners of nuclear power plants in many regions have operated for decades without any major public safety incidents, the occurrence of infrequent but high-magnitude incidents anywhere in the world can have major impacts on the entire nuclear power industry. Companies that own and operate nuclear plants could face a loss of their license to operate, either entirely or in the operation of nuclear plants, as well as many other financial consequences in the event of an accident\u2014though companies carry insurance and may have legal protections from certain liabilities. Failure to comply with the safety regulations can be extremely expensive to nuclear power operators; in extreme circumstances it can make the continued operation of the plant uneconomical. As a result of significant financial repercussions, both from ongoing safety compliance as well as the materialization of tail risk incidents, companies that own or operate nuclear plants need to be vigilant in the safety compliance, best practices, and upgrades of their facilities. They also need to maintain robust emergency preparedness training for their staff and a strong safety culture. These measures can reduce the probability that accidents will occur and enable a company to effectively detect and respond to such incidents.\n\n## Metrics\n\nIF-EU-540a.1.
