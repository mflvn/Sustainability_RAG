{"page_number": 310, "text_content": "# End-Use Efficiency & Demand\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nEnergy efficiency is a low-lifecycle-cost method to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as less electricity needs to be generated to provide the same end-use energy services. Utilities can partake in a wide range of activities to promote energy efficiency and conservation among their customers. Such strategies include offering rebates for energy-efficient appliances, weatherizing customers' homes, educating customers on energy-saving methods, offering incentives to customers to curb electricity use during times of peak demand (\"demand response\"), and investing in technology such as smart meters, which allows customers to track their energy usage\u2014among many other strategies. These efforts, which save consumers money, can also manifest in lowered operating costs for electric utilities because they can reduce peak demand. Furthermore, depending on the sentiment of the utilities commission in a company's region, energy efficiency can be a regulatory priority before new builds are considered. How an electric utility stands to gain or lose from this trend toward GHG mitigation is significantly predicated on its regulatory environment. Traditional rate structures generally do not give electric utilities an incentive for energy efficiency, and further, they may economically suffer from reductions in customer demand. This is increasingly driving electric utilities, and their regulators and customers, to pursue alternative ratemaking. Such alternative rate design often \"decouples\" utility revenues from customer consumption, and may also build in explicit incentives for end-use efficiency and demand reductions. Overall, companies whose strategic plan strives to reduce their downside risks from demand fluctuations, gain adequate and timely returns on needed efficiency investments. Further, lowering costs through efficiency initiatives help position utility companies to earn stronger risk-adjusted returns over the long term.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-EU-420a.2. Percentage of electric load served by smart grid technology\n\n1    The entity shall disclose the percentage of its electric load, in megawatt hours, served by smart grid technology.\n\n1.1    The electric load served by smart grid technology is defined as the amount of electricity delivered to the entity's customers that incorporates the use of smart grid technologies to meet the electricity demand of the consumer.\n\n1.2    A smart grid is defined, consistent with the International Energy Agency (IEA), as an electricity network that uses digital and other advanced technologies to monitor and manage the transport of electricity from all generation sources to meet the varying electricity demands of end users. Smart grids coordinate the needs and capabilities of all generators, grid operators, end users, and electricity market stakeholders to operate all parts of the system as efficiently as possible, minimizing costs and environmental impacts while maximizing system reliability, resilience and stability."}
