{"page_number": 312, "text_content": "3 The entity may discuss the type of smart grid technology through which its electric load is served, the customer types that are utilizing the technology (e.g., residential, commercial, or industrial), whether technologies are owned by the utility or the customer, and any plans for further integration of smart grid capabilities.\n\nNote to IF-EU-420a.2\n\n1 The entity shall discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with the development and operations of a smart grid, including, where relevant:\n\n1.1 Demand-response and end-user efficiency opportunities (e.g., smoothing of the demand curve, increased cost-effective electric generation, improved incorporation of distributed generation, and increased generation and transmission efficiency)\n\n1.2 Political and deployment challenges (e.g., opposition to smart grid development, disparate degrees of technology deployment, and economic dis-incentives)\n\nIF-EU-420a.3. Customer electricity savings from efficiency measures, by market\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the total amount of electricity savings delivered to customers, in megawatt hours, from energy efficiency measures during the reporting period, for each of its markets.\n\n1.1 Markets are defined as those operations that are subject to distinct public utility regulatory oversight.\n\n1.2 Electricity savings are defined according to the gross savings approach as the changes in energy consumption and/or demand that results from program-related actions taken by participants in an efficiency program, regardless of why they participated.\n\n1.2.1 The entity may list those markets where it reports electricity savings on a net electricity savings basis, and thus, may be different from the figures disclosed here. Net electricity savings are defined as changes in consumption that are specifically attributable to an energy efficiency program, and that would not have occurred in the absence of the program.\n\n2 Electricity savings shall be calculated on a gross basis but consistent with the methodology set forth in national, state, or local evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) regulations where such savings occur."}
