{"page_number": 304, "text_content": "1.2    The scope of GHG emissions includes the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083).\n\n2    The entity shall discuss its emission reduction target(s) and analyze its performance against the target(s), including the following, where relevant:\n\n2.1    The scope of the emission reduction target (e.g., the percentage of total emissions to which the target is applicable);\n\n2.2    Whether the target is absolute- or intensity-based, and the metric denominator, if it is an intensity-based target;\n\n2.3    The percentage reduction against the base year, with the base year representing the first year against which emissions are evaluated toward the achievement of the target;\n\n2.4    The timelines for the reduction activity, including the start year, the target year, and the base year;\n\n2.5    The mechanism(s) for achieving the target; and\n\n2.6    Any circumstances in which the target or base year emissions have been, or may be, recalculated retrospectively or the target or base year has been reset.\n\n3    The entity shall discuss its strategy to manage risks and opportunities associated with the GHG emissions regulatory environment, which may include, but are not limited to:\n\n3.1    Any changes it has made or plans to make to its business structure or model\n\n3.2    The development of new technologies or services\n\n3.3    Any changes it has made or plans to make to its operational process, control, or organizational structures\n\n3.4    Influencing the regulatory or legislative process and outcomes, including but not limited to, interactions with regulators, regulatory agencies, utility commissions, legislators, and policymakers\n\n4    The entity may discuss its involvement in green power markets, including the number of customers served (by customer category) and the corresponding electricity generated.\n\n4.1    Green power markets are defined as an optional utility service that allows customers the opportunity to support a greater level of utility company investment in renewable energy technologies.\n\n4.2    The entity may disclose instances where the provision of green power markets are required by state renewable portfolio standards."}
