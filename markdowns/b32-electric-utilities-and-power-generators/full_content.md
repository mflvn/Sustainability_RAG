# Industry Description

The Electric Utilities & Power Generators industry is made up of companies that generate electricity; build, own, and operate transmission and distribution (T&D) lines; and sell electricity. Utilities generate electricity from a number of different sources, commonly including coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, hydropower, solar, wind, and other renewable and fossil fuel energy sources. The industry comprises companies operating in both regulated and unregulated business structures. Regulated utilities maintain a business model in which they accept comprehensive oversight from regulators on their pricing mechanisms and their allowed return on equity, among other types of regulation, in exchange for their license to operate as a monopoly. Unregulated companies, or merchant power companies, are often independent power producers (IPPs) that generate electricity to sell to the wholesale market, which includes regulated utility buyers and other end-users. Furthermore, the industry is divided across regulated and deregulated power markets—referring to how far up the value chain regulated utility operations span. Regulated markets typically contain vertically integrated utilities that own and operate everything from the generation of power to its retail distribution. Deregulated markets commonly split generation from distribution, designed to encourage competition at the wholesale power level. Overall, companies in the industry are challenged with the complex mission of providing reliable, accessible, low-cost power while balancing the protection of human life and the environment.

Note: The SASB Electric Utilities & Power Generators Industry covers activities related only to electricity provision, not to natural gas provision. Some utilities may operate in both electricity and natural gas markets. Utilities undertaking activities related to natural gas sourcing and distribution should also consider the separate Gas Utilities & Distributors Industry Standard (IF-GU).

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions & Energy Resource Planning

## Topic Summary

Electricity generation represents the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the world. These emissions, mainly carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, are mostly by-products of fossil fuels combustion. The transmission and/or distribution (T&D) segments of the industry are responsible for a negligible amount of its emissions. Electric utility companies could face significant operating and capital expenditures for mitigating GHG emissions as environmental regulations become increasingly stringent. While many of these costs can be passed on to a utility's customers, some power generators, especially in deregulated markets, may not be able to recoup these costs. Companies can reduce GHG emissions from electricity generation mainly through careful planning of their infrastructure investments to ensure an energy mix capable of meeting the emissions requirements set forth by regulations and by implementing industry-leading technologies and processes. Being proactive in cost-effectively reducing GHG emissions can create a competitive advantage for companies and mitigate unanticipated regulatory compliance costs. Failure to properly estimate capital-expenditure needs and permitting costs, or other difficulties in reducing GHG emissions, could result in significant negative impacts on returns in the future in the form of asset write-downs, costs of obtaining carbon credits, or unexpected increases in operating and capital expenditures. Regulatory emphasis on this issue will likely increase in the coming decades, as exemplified by the international emissions-reduction agreement made at the 21st session of the United Nations Conference of the Parties that took place in late 2015.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Electricity generation is one of the most water-intensive industries in the world in terms of water withdrawals. Thermoelectric power plants—typically coal, nuclear, and natural gas—are dependent on large quantities of water for cooling purposes. The industry is facing increasing water-related supply and regulatory risks, potentially requiring capital investment in technology or even resulting in stranded assets. As water supplies tighten in many regions—and electricity generation, agriculture, and community use compete for water supplies in the coming decade—power plants may increasingly be unable to operate at their full capacity, or at all, because of region-specific water constraints. The availability of water is a key factor to consider when calculating the future value of many electricity-generating assets and for evaluating existing proposals for new generation sources. Heightened water scarcity—due to factors such as increasing consumption and reduced supplies as a result of climate change, which could result in more frequent or intense droughts—could prompt regulatory authorities to limit companies' ability to withdraw necessary amounts of water, especially in regions with high baseline water stress. Furthermore, companies must contend with the growing regulations related to the significant biodiversity impacts that such large withdrawals can cause. To mitigate risks, companies can both invest in more efficient water-usage systems for existing plants and place strategic priority on assessing long-term water availability, as well as water-related biodiversity risks, when siting new power plants.

# End-Use Efficiency & Demand

## Topic Summary

Energy efficiency is a low-lifecycle-cost method to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as less electricity needs to be generated to provide the same end-use energy services. Utilities can partake in a wide range of activities to promote energy efficiency and conservation among their customers. Such strategies include offering rebates for energy-efficient appliances, weatherizing customers' homes, educating customers on energy-saving methods, offering incentives to customers to curb electricity use during times of peak demand ("demand response"), and investing in technology such as smart meters, which allows customers to track their energy usage—among many other strategies. These efforts, which save consumers money, can also manifest in lowered operating costs for electric utilities because they can reduce peak demand. Furthermore, depending on the sentiment of the utilities commission in a company's region, energy efficiency can be a regulatory priority before new builds are considered. How an electric utility stands to gain or lose from this trend toward GHG mitigation is significantly predicated on its regulatory environment. Traditional rate structures generally do not give electric utilities an incentive for energy efficiency, and further, they may economically suffer from reductions in customer demand. This is increasingly driving electric utilities, and their regulators and customers, to pursue alternative ratemaking. Such alternative rate design often "decouples" utility revenues from customer consumption, and may also build in explicit incentives for end-use efficiency and demand reductions. Overall, companies whose strategic plan strives to reduce their downside risks from demand fluctuations, gain adequate and timely returns on needed efficiency investments. Further, lowering costs through efficiency initiatives help position utility companies to earn stronger risk-adjusted returns over the long term.

# Nuclear Safety & Emergency Management

## Topic Summary

Nuclear incidents, while exceedingly rare, can have significant human health and environmental consequences as nuclear accidents can be severe if they do occur. While owners of nuclear power plants in many regions have operated for decades without any major public safety incidents, the occurrence of infrequent but high-magnitude incidents anywhere in the world can have major impacts on the entire nuclear power industry. Companies that own and operate nuclear plants could face a loss of their license to operate, either entirely or in the operation of nuclear plants, as well as many other financial consequences in the event of an accident—though companies carry insurance and may have legal protections from certain liabilities. Failure to comply with the safety regulations can be extremely expensive to nuclear power operators; in extreme circumstances it can make the continued operation of the plant uneconomical. As a result of significant financial repercussions, both from ongoing safety compliance as well as the materialization of tail risk incidents, companies that own or operate nuclear plants need to be vigilant in the safety compliance, best practices, and upgrades of their facilities. They also need to maintain robust emergency preparedness training for their staff and a strong safety culture. These measures can reduce the probability that accidents will occur and enable a company to effectively detect and respond to such incidents.

# Grid Resiliency

## Topic Summary

Electricity is critical for the continued function of most elements of modern life, from medicine to finance, creating a societal reliance on continuous service. There are potentially high societal costs from major disruptions to electricity infrastructure. Disruptions can be caused by extreme weather events, natural disasters, and cyber attacks. As the frequency and severity of extreme weather events associated with climate change continues to increase, all segments of electric utilities companies—and especially major transmission and distribution (T&D) operations—will face increasing physical threats to their infrastructure. This could result in frequent or significant service disruptions, outages, and the need to upgrade or repair damaged or compromised equipment, all of which may result in substantial costs and damaged perspectives of regulators and customers. The increased usage of smart grid technology has several benefits, including strengthening the resiliency of the grid to extreme weather events. However, this technology can make the grid more vulnerable to cyber attacks, as it provides hackers more entryways into infrastructure systems. Companies need to implement strategies that minimize the probability and magnitude of impacts from extreme weather events and cyber attacks. They can remain competitive in the face of increasing external competition by actively submitting compelling rate cases to improve the reliability, resilience, and quality of their infrastructure.

#### Page 320

4.1.1 The entity should collect values of daily SAIDI for five sequential years, ending on the last day of the last complete reporting period. If fewer than five years of historical data are available, use all of the available historical data.

4.1.2 If any day in the data set has a value of zero for SAIDI, replace it with the lowest non-zero SAIDI value in the data set—this permits taking the logarithm of every day.

4.1.3 Take the natural logarithm (ln) of each daily SAIDI value in the data set.

4.1.4 Find α (Alpha), the average of the logarithms (also known as the logaverage) of the data set.

4.1.5 Find β (Beta), the standard deviation of the logarithms (also known as the log-average) of the data set.
