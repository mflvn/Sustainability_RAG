The use of electricity and fossil fuels by auto parts manufacturers in their production processes results in direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Purchased electricity represents a major share of the energy used in the Auto Parts industry. Sustainability initiatives such as incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy are making alternative sources of energy more cost-competitive. Regulators and consumers are also pressuring the industry to reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important for companies in energy-intensive industries to manage the cost and reliability risks associated with their overall energy efficiency, their reliance on different types of energy, and their access to alternative energy sources.\n\n## Metrics\n\nTR-AP-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable\n\n1. The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n   1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n   1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.\n\n   1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n2. The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.\n\n   2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3. The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.\n\n   3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.\n\n   3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption."}
