{"page_number": 607, "text_content": "# Design for Fuel Efficiency\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nAutomobile manufacturers are increasingly demanding motor parts and components that can help reduce the fuel consumption of the vehicles they sell. Fuel-efficient components and parts play a vital role in reducing tailpipe emissions of automobiles through energy efficiency gains and contributions to weight reductions, among other factors. Auto parts companies that can design and manufacture such parts will be better positioned to increase sales to auto manufacturers that are increasingly facing stricter environmental regulations and customer preferences for more environmentally friendly cars.\n\n## Metrics\n\nTR-AP-410a.1. Revenue from products designed to increase fuel efficiency and/or reduce emissions\n\n1. The entity shall disclose its total revenue from products that are designed to increase fuel efficiency and/or reduce emissions during their use phase.\n\n   1.1 Products designed to increase fuel efficiency and/or reduce emissions are defined as those that the entity has tested, modeled, or otherwise shown to improve fuel efficiency and/or eliminate or lower emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), nitrogen oxide (NOx), particulate matter (PM), sulfur oxides (SOx), and other air pollutants during their use phase.\n\n   1.2 The use phase is defined as the course over which the product is used by a customer or consumer as a final product and/or to generate a final product (e.g., in a manufacturing or production process).\n\n   1.3 The scope of disclosure includes products that impart an incremental improvement to fuel efficiency and/or emission reduction, insofar as the entity can demonstrate that the improvement is meaningful, such as through alignment with the milestones set forth in Section 5, \"Key Sectors / Ensuring efficient mobility\" of the European Commission's Road Map to a Resource Efficient Europe and/or with EU Directive 2012/27/EU (Energy Efficiency Directive).\n\n   1.4 The scope of disclosure excludes products that offer improved fuel efficiency and/or reduced emissions in an ancillary or indirect way (e.g., a conventional product that is slightly lighter than the previous generation of the product).\n\n2. Examples of products that may increase fuel efficiency and/or reduce emissions include, but are not limited to, those relating to: electrification of auxiliary systems such as oil and water pumps, waste heat recovery, improved aerodynamics, hybrid and advanced fuel technologies, improvements to combustion efficiency, idle reduction, alternative cooling systems, electric power steering, hybrid-enabled braking technologies, low rolling resistance (LRR) new and retread tire technologies, and engine management systems/products."}
