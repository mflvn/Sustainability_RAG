{"page_number": 604, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nCompanies in the Auto Parts industry supply motor vehicle parts and accessories to original equipment manufacturers (OEM). Auto parts companies typically specialize in the manufacturing and assembly of certain parts or accessories, such as engine exhaust systems, alternative drivetrains, hybrid systems, catalytic converters, aluminum wheels (rims), tires, rearview mirrors, and onboard electrical and electronic equipment. Although the larger automotive industry includes several tiers of suppliers that provide parts and raw materials used to assemble motor vehicles, the scope of SASB's Auto Parts industry includes only Tier 1 suppliers that supply parts directly to OEMs. The scope of the industry excludes captive suppliers, such as engine and stamping facilities, that are owned and operated by OEMs. Similarity, it excludes Tier 2 suppliers, which provide inputs for the Auto Parts industry."}
