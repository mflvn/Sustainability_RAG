{"page_number": 393, "text_content": "# Sustainability Services\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nIn the Real Estate Services industry, buildings owned or occupied by clients generally have significant sustainability impacts. Buildings, and the activities that take place within them, drive energy consumption, direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption, waste generation, and indoor environmental quality concerns that can impact the health of occupants. Companies in the industry have an opportunity to improve the sustainability impacts of buildings and their operations through sustainability-related services. These services may include utility data management, energy procurement, energy and water benchmarking, resource efficiency improvements, activities related to sustainability certifications, and sustainability consulting and training. Companies in the industry can further impact building sustainability by arranging leases that incentivize both owners and tenants to enhance sustainability performance, while yielding financial benefits for both parties. Providing these services can drive new revenue growth and increase client retention; effective sustainability services can benefit owners and/or tenants through improved asset values, increased tenant demand, decreased operating costs, and improved tenant experiences.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-RS-410a.1.
