# Sustainability Services

## Topic Summary

In the Real Estate Services industry, buildings owned or occupied by clients generally have significant sustainability impacts. Buildings, and the activities that take place within them, drive energy consumption, direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption, waste generation, and indoor environmental quality concerns that can impact the health of occupants. Companies in the industry have an opportunity to improve the sustainability impacts of buildings and their operations through sustainability-related services. These services may include utility data management, energy procurement, energy and water benchmarking, resource efficiency improvements, activities related to sustainability certifications, and sustainability consulting and training. Companies in the industry can further impact building sustainability by arranging leases that incentivize both owners and tenants to enhance sustainability performance, while yielding financial benefits for both parties. Providing these services can drive new revenue growth and increase client retention; effective sustainability services can benefit owners and/or tenants through improved asset values, increased tenant demand, decreased operating costs, and improved tenant experiences.

## Metrics

### IF-RS-410a.1. Revenue from energy and sustainability services

1 The entity shall disclose its revenue from energy and sustainability services.

1.1 Energy and sustainability services are defined as services provided to clients directly related to resource efficiency (including energy, water, and waste), utility data management, energy procurement, obtaining and retaining sustainability and resource-related certifications, environmental reporting, and corporate sustainability consulting and training.

1.1.1 Examples of energy and sustainability services include, but are not limited to, energy management and performance monitoring (e.g., through sub-meters to measure electric usage); energy, water, and waste benchmarking or ratings-scheme services; advisory services related to renewable energy procurement; services related to LEED, ENERGY STAR®, or other sustainability-related building certifications; energy- and sustainability-related building valuation analysis; and energy- and sustainability-related client training or consulting.

1.2 The scope of energy and sustainability services excludes services that impart improved energy and sustainability performance in an ancillary, indirect, or minimal way, as well as environmental services that are part of the ordinary operation and maintenance of buildings (e.g., facilities maintenance and/or janitorial services).

2 The scope of disclosure includes, but is not limited to, services provided to leasing clients, project- and development-service clients, and capital market and investment management clients.

Note to IF-RS-410a.1

1 The entity shall provide a description of the energy and sustainability services it
offers, where relevant information includes, but is not limited to:

1.1 The degree to which energy and sustainability services are integrated into,
or distinct from, the entity's base property management services, including,
but not limited to, the sales process for such services, the amount of overlap
between clients for base property management services and energy and
sustainability services, and the level of consistency of contract lengths and
terms among base property management services and energy and
sustainability services.

1.2 The market dynamics of energy and sustainability services, including
competition, risks and opportunities, market share, customer demands and
preferences, market growth, and legislative and regulatory impacts.

1.3 Opportunities associated with providing market-leading energy and
sustainability services, such as the potential to win a new client based solely
on energy and sustainability services, which may lead to additional non-
energy and sustainability-related services in the future.

1.4 Risks associated with providing inadequate or insufficient energy and
sustainability services, such as the potential to lose a client based on
inadequate or insufficient energy and sustainability services.

2 The entity may disclose the number of energy- and sustainability-accredited
professionals it employs.

3 The entity may disclose the estimated energy savings, greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions reductions, water savings, waste reductions, or other performance
measurements associated with the results of the energy and sustainability services
it provides to clients.

IF-RS-410a.2. (1) Floor area and (2) number of buildings under management
provided with energy and sustainability services

1 The entity shall disclose (1) the floor area under management for which it
provided energy and/or sustainability-related services during the reporting period.

1.1 Floor area under management is defined as the gross rentable floor area
where property management services are provided and for which the real
estate owner has operational control.

1.1.1 Operational control is defined, consistent with the 2018 GRESB®
Real Estate Assessment Reference Guide, as an instance when the
real estate owner has "the ability to introduce and implement
operating policies, health and safety policies, and/or environmental
policies."

1.2 Energy and sustainability services are defined as services provided to
clients directly related to resource efficiency (including energy, water, and
waste), utility data management, energy procurement, obtaining and
retaining sustainability and resource-related certifications, environmental
reporting, and corporate sustainability consulting and training.

1 The entity shall disclose (1) the floor area under management that obtained an energy rating during the reporting period.

1.1 Floor area under management is defined as the gross rentable floor area where property management services are provided and for which the real estate owner has operational control.

2 The entity shall disclose (2) the number of buildings that obtained an energy rating during the reporting period, where:

2.1 The number of buildings under management is defined as distinct buildings or real estate assets where property management services are provided and where the real estate owner has operational control.

2.2 An energy rating is defined, consistent with the 2018 GRESB® Real Estate Assessment Reference Guide, as a scheme that measures the energy performance of buildings.

2.3 The scope of energy rating schemes includes:

2.3.1 ENERGY STAR® for operations in the United States and Canada;

2.3.2 EU Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) for operations in the European Union;

2.3.3 National Australian Build Environment Rating System (NABERS) Energy for operations in Australia;

2.3.4 NABERSNZ for operations in New Zealand;

2.3.5 Government energy efficiency benchmarking; and

#### Page 396

2.3.6 Other energy rating schemes that can be demonstrated to have substantially equivalent criteria, methodology, and presentation of results to those schemes above.
