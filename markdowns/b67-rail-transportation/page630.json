{"text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Rail Transportation industry consists of companies that provide rail freight shipping and support services. Key activities include shipping containerized and bulk freight, including consumer goods and commodities. Rail companies typically own, maintain, and operate their rail networks, which may require significant capital expenditures. The U.S. operates the longest railroad network in the world, followed closely by Russia, China, India, Canada, Germany, and France. The industry exhibits economies of density due to its network effects, lending itself to natural monopoly conditions. Together with the large sunk costs of rail infrastructure, this provides a competitive advantage to incumbent firms in the industry and creates barriers to entry for new firms.\n\nNote: The scope of the Rail Transportation industry does not include passenger rail transportation.\n\n---\n\n[^125]: Note to TR-RA-000.A \u2013 The scope of disclosure includes all carloads that the entity transported in conjunction with the shipping of freight (including freight that is not containerized) for its customers.\n\n[^126]: Note to TR-RA-000.B \u2013 Intermodal units include shipping containers and truck trailers that can be transported across modes of transportation.\n\n[^127]: Note to TR-RA-000.C \u2013 Track miles include route miles (the total extent of routes available for trains to operate) and take into account multiple track routes such that each route mile with double track is considered two track miles.", "page_number": 630}
