Despite relatively low emissions compared to other transportation industries, fuel management has implications for companies in the industry in terms of operating costs and regulatory compliance. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) including carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) are of particular importance to government regulators concerned about climate change. Intensifying regulation of locomotive exhaust emissions and high fuel costs provide incentives for rail companies to invest in fuel efficiency enhancements to manage emissions. This can increase operational efficiency and impact the cost structure of rail companies, with chronic and acute impacts on value and competitive position both within the industry and compared to other modes of transport.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### TR-RA-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions\n\n1. The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083).\n\n   1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO\u2082-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).\n\n   1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.\n\n2. Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).\n\n   2.1 Acceptable calculation methodologies include those that conform to the GHG Protocol as the base reference, but provide additional guidance, such as industry- or region-specific guidance. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n      2.1.1 GHG Reporting Guidance for the Aerospace Industry published by International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG)\n\n      2.1.2 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidance: Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n\n      2.1.3 India GHG Inventory Program"}
