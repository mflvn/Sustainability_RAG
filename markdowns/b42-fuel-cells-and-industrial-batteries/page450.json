{"page_number": 450, "text_content": "# Product Efficiency\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nBoth customer demand and regulatory requirements are driving innovation in energy-efficient products with lower environmental impacts and lower total cost of ownership. Therefore, research and development in the Fuel Cells & Industrial Batteries industry that drive energy and thermal efficiency and enhance storage capacities can lower barriers to adoption. Advances in battery technology to increase storage capabilities and improve charging efficiencies, while lowering costs for customers, are critical for the integration of renewable energy technologies into the grid. Fuel cell and industrial battery manufacturers that are able to improve efficiency in the use phase will be able to increase revenues and market share, pressured by stricter environmental regulations, high energy costs, and customer preferences.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### RR-FC-410a.1. Average storage capacity of batteries, by product application and technology type\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the average storage capacity of batteries by product application and technology type, weighted by unit sales volume per product application and technology type.\n\n1.1 Storage capacity shall be measured as the specific energy, or gravimetric energy density, of batteries, and is calculated as the ratio of nominal energy in watt-hours to the mass of the product in kilograms: watt-hours / kilograms (Wh/kg).\n\n2 The entity shall measure and disclose performance in accordance with the applicable product application and/or technology type standard(s), and shall disclose the standard(s) utilized for performance measurement.\n\n2.1 Applicable standard(s) may include SAE J240\u2014Automotive storage batteries and SAE J2185\u2014Heavy-duty storage batteries.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose performance by the following application types, where applicable: portable, motive, stationary, and \"all other,\" each further categorized by the following technology types, where applicable: lead-based, nickel-based, lithium-based, sodium-based, and \"all other.\"\n\n3.1 The entity may include additional categories of application types and/or technology types where appropriate, including categories for new products with low sales volumes but strategic importance in terms of product efficiency or other attributes.\n\n### RR-FC-410a.2. Average energy efficiency of fuel cells as (1) electrical efficiency and (2) thermal efficiency, by product application and technology type\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the average energy efficiency of fuel cells as (1) electrical efficiency and (2) thermal efficiency, weighted by unit sales volume per product application and technology type.\n\n1.1 Electrical efficiency is calculated as net electricity produced divided by total fuel energy input."}
