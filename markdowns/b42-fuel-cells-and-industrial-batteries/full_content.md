# Industry Description

The Fuel Cells & Industrial Batteries industry consists of companies that manufacture fuel cells for energy production and energy storage equipment such as batteries. Manufacturers in this industry mainly sell products to companies for varied energy-generation and energy-storage applications and intensities, from commercial business applications to large-scale energy projects for utilities. Companies in the industry typically have global operations and sell products to a global marketplace.

Note: For the purposes of SASB standards, this industry does not include fuel cells or batteries used in light automotive vehicle applications. See SASB standards for the Auto Parts industry (TR-AP) for details on reporting this business segment. This industry also does not include non-industrial batteries for personal consumer use, which are classified under the Household & Personal Products industry (CG-HP).

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Manufacturing in the Fuel Cells & Industrial Batteries industry requires energy to power machines and cooling, ventilation, lighting, and product-testing systems. Purchased electricity can represent a major share of the energy sources used in the industry and can account for a notable proportion of the total cost of materials and value added. Various sustainability factors are contributing to an increase in the cost of conventional electricity while making alternative sources cost-competitive. Energy efficiency efforts can have a significant positive impact on operational efficiency and profitability, especially given the fact that many companies operate on relatively low or negative margins. By improving the efficiency of the manufacturing process and exploring alternative energy sources, fuel cell and industrial battery companies can reduce both their indirect environmental impacts and their operating expenses.

# Product Efficiency

## Topic Summary

Both customer demand and regulatory requirements are driving innovation in energy-efficient products with lower environmental impacts and lower total cost of ownership. Therefore, research and development in the Fuel Cells & Industrial Batteries industry that drive energy and thermal efficiency and enhance storage capacities can lower barriers to adoption. Advances in battery technology to increase storage capabilities and improve charging efficiencies, while lowering costs for customers, are critical for the integration of renewable energy technologies into the grid. Fuel cell and industrial battery manufacturers that are able to improve efficiency in the use phase will be able to increase revenues and market share, pressured by stricter environmental regulations, high energy costs, and customer preferences.
