{"text_content": "# Energy Management\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nManufacturing in the Fuel Cells & Industrial Batteries industry requires energy to power machines and cooling, ventilation, lighting, and product-testing systems. Purchased electricity can represent a major share of the energy sources used in the industry and can account for a notable proportion of the total cost of materials and value added. Various sustainability factors are contributing to an increase in the cost of conventional electricity while making alternative sources cost-competitive. Energy efficiency efforts can have a significant positive impact on operational efficiency and profitability, especially given the fact that many companies operate on relatively low or negative margins. By improving the efficiency of the manufacturing process and exploring alternative energy sources, fuel cell and industrial battery companies can reduce both their indirect environmental impacts and their operating expenses.\n\n## Metrics\n\nRR-FC-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable\n\n1    The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n1.1  The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n1.2  The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.\n\n1.3  In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n2    The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.\n\n2.1  The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3    The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.\n\n3.1  Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.\n\n3.2  The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.", "page_number": 448}
