Companies in this industry operate amusement parks, movie theaters, ski resorts, sports stadiums, and athletic clubs and other venues. Leisure facilities companies mainly generate revenue by providing live, digital, and/or interactive entertainment to millions of guests and customers annually across various locations.\n\n93 Note to SV-LF-000.A \u2013 Attendance is the total number of visits by customers to any leisure facility in the entity's portfolio that is branded by the operator (i.e., licensed) or in which it has controlling ownership.\n94 Note to SV-LF-000.B \u2013 Customer-days is the aggregate total amount of time customers spent visiting any leisure facility in the entity's portfolio, calculated as the sum of the visitation time of each customer. For facilities that sell day passes (e.g., amusement parks), but do not track entry and exit times, the hours of operation open to guests can be used for estimation. For facilities that sell single unit entry passes (e.g., movie theaters), the average visitation time can be used for estimation.\n\n544", "page_number": 544}
