# Industry Description

The Leisure Facilities industry is comprised of companies that operate entertainment, travel, and recreation facilities and services. Companies in this industry operate amusement parks, movie theaters, ski resorts, sports stadiums, and athletic clubs and other venues. Leisure facilities companies mainly generate revenue by providing live, digital, and/or interactive entertainment to millions of guests and customers annually across various locations.

93 Note to SV-LF-000.A – Attendance is the total number of visits by customers to any leisure facility in the entity's portfolio that is branded by the operator (i.e., licensed) or in which it has controlling ownership.
94 Note to SV-LF-000.B – Customer-days is the aggregate total amount of time customers spent visiting any leisure facility in the entity's portfolio, calculated as the sum of the visitation time of each customer. For facilities that sell day passes (e.g., amusement parks), but do not track entry and exit times, the hours of operation open to guests can be used for estimation. For facilities that sell single unit entry passes (e.g., movie theaters), the average visitation time can be used for estimation.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Leisure facilities companies operate large outdoor and indoor facilities that may consume a significant amount of energy. Most of the industry's electricity usage is commercially purchased, which indirectly leads to the release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a significant contributor to climate change. Companies in the industry are implementing energy management best practices in order to reduce operating expenses and environmental impacts and to improve their reputation with guests, who are increasingly concerned about environmental sustainability.

## Metrics

SV-LF-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable

1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.

2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3.3 The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green‐e Energy Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green‐e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity.

3.3.1 For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.2 For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.3 The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of renewable energy.

3.4 For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from hydro and biomass sources is limited to the following:

3.4.1 Energy from hydro sources is limited to those that are certified by the Low Impact Hydropower Institute or that are eligible for a state Renewable Portfolio Standard;

3.4.2 Energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state renewable portfolio standard.

4 The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data including electricity from solar or wind energy).
