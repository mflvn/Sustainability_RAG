# Industry Description

The Wind Technology & Project Developers industry comprises companies that manufacture wind turbines, blades, towers, and other components of wind power systems. Companies that develop, build, and manage wind energy projects are also included within the scope of this industry. Manufacturers may also offer post-sale maintenance and support services. Turbines can be installed onshore or offshore, which can cause differences in wind-generating capacity and create challenges in project development for each type of installation. Most major wind technology companies operate globally.

[^78]: Note to RR-WT-000.A – Wind turbine class is defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission's IEC 61400-1, Edition 3.0—Design requirements. Wind turbine class shall be determined by the rating of the turbine.

[^79]: Note to RR-WT-000.B – Wind turbine class is defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission's IEC 61400-1, Edition 3.0—Design requirements. Wind turbine class shall be determined by the rating of the turbine.

# Materials Efficiency

## Topic Summary

The Wind Technology & Project Developers industry's long-term success depends on its ability to produce energy at a comparatively lower cost than other energy sources. Steel and other materials purchases are one of the largest cost components of turbines and inputs such as steel have exhibited price volatility in the past. In recent years, wind turbines have grown in size, in terms of both the tower height and the swept area of the rotor, to improve energy output and increase the potential for wind energy production in more areas. To achieve this expansion cost-effectively, companies can employ innovative methods to increase turbine output while using materials more efficiently. This could influence companies' competitiveness and market share, costs of production, and operational risks related to the supply and price volatility of raw materials, as well as the ability of the industry to scale.

## Metrics

### RR-WT-440b.1. Top five materials consumed, by weight

1. For each of the following wind turbine classes, the entity shall disclose the weight, in metric tons, of the five materials consumed in the greatest amounts, by weight, in delivered wind turbines during the reporting period.

2. The scope of disclosure includes materials weights in the final delivered turbine, including the nacelle, blades, and tower, and excludes the weight of materials consumed in production (e.g., waste), freight, storage, and installation (e.g., foundation).
