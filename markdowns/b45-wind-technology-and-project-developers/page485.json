Average top head mass per turbine capacity, by wind turbine class\n\n1 For each of the following wind turbine classes, the entity shall disclose the average top head mass per turbine capacity of turbines delivered during the reporting period, weighted by turbine deliveries per wind turbine class.\n\n1.1 Wind turbine classes are defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission's IEC 61400-1, Edition 3.0\u2014Design requirements:\n\n1.1.1 IEC Wind Turbine Class I\n\n1.1.2 IEC Wind Turbine Class II\n\n1.1.3 IEC Wind Turbine Class III\n\n1.1.4 IEC Wind Turbine Class IV\n\n1.1.5 IEC Wind Turbine Class S\n\n2 Wind turbine class shall be determined by the rating of the turbine.\n\n3 Average top head mass per turbine capacity shall be calculated as the mass of the top head in metric tons divided by turbine capacity in megawatts (MW).\n\n3.1 The top head shall include the turbine nacelle and the turbine rotor.\n\n3.2 The top head shall exclude the blades.\n\n3.3 Turbine capacity is the rated turbine capacity, defined as the maximum output (generation) of a wind turbine, in megawatts (MW), also referred to as \"nameplate capacity.\"\n\n4 The entity may disclose performance in additional wind turbine classes, including the following:\n\n4.1 Turbulence characteristics\n\n4.2 Mixed class (e.g., IEC Wind Turbine Class I / II)\n\n4.3 Onshore\n\n4.4 Offshore\n\n## RR-WT-440b.3. Description of approach to optimize materials efficiency of wind turbine design\n\n1 The entity shall describe its approach to improving the materials efficiency of wind turbines, including design considerations and materials selection to optimize:\n\n1.1 Amount of materials consumed\n\n1.2 Capacity and capacity factor by materials consumed\n\n1.3 Lifespan\n\n2 The scope of disclosure shall include materials selection and modifications to wind turbine design as well as operational control software (e.g., SCADA systems) that may increase the materials efficiency of wind turbines."}
