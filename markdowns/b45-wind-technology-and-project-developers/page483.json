{"page_number": 483, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Wind Technology & Project Developers industry comprises companies that manufacture wind turbines, blades, towers, and other components of wind power systems. Companies that develop, build, and manage wind energy projects are also included within the scope of this industry. Manufacturers may also offer post-sale maintenance and support services. Turbines can be installed onshore or offshore, which can cause differences in wind-generating capacity and create challenges in project development for each type of installation. Most major wind technology companies operate globally.\n\n[^78]: Note to RR-WT-000.A \u2013 Wind turbine class is defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission's IEC 61400-1, Edition 3.0\u2014Design requirements. Wind turbine class shall be determined by the rating of the turbine.\n\n[^79]: Note to RR-WT-000.B \u2013 Wind turbine class is defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission's IEC 61400-1, Edition 3.0\u2014Design requirements.
