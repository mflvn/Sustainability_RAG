Steel and other materials purchases are one of the largest cost components of turbines and inputs such as steel have exhibited price volatility in the past. In recent years, wind turbines have grown in size, in terms of both the tower height and the swept area of the rotor, to improve energy output and increase the potential for wind energy production in more areas. To achieve this expansion cost-effectively, companies can employ innovative methods to increase turbine output while using materials more efficiently. This could influence companies' competitiveness and market share, costs of production, and operational risks related to the supply and price volatility of raw materials, as well as the ability of the industry to scale.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### RR-WT-440b.1. Top five materials consumed, by weight\n\n1. For each of the following wind turbine classes, the entity shall disclose the weight, in metric tons, of the five materials consumed in the greatest amounts, by weight, in delivered wind turbines during the reporting period.\n\n2. The scope of disclosure includes materials weights in the final delivered turbine, including the nacelle, blades, and tower, and excludes the weight of materials consumed in production (e.g., waste), freight, storage, and installation (e.g., foundation).\n\n3. Materials may include, but are not limited to, aluminum, carbon fiber, copper, fiberglass, iron, or steel.\n\n4. The entity may disclose the weight of the five materials consumed in the greatest amounts by wind turbine class.\n\n   4.1 Wind turbine classes are defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission's IEC 61400-1, Edition 3.0\u2014Design requirements:\n\n   4.1.1 IEC Wind Turbine Class I\n\n   4.1.2 IEC Wind Turbine Class II\n\n   4.1.3 IEC Wind Turbine Class III\n\n   4.1.4 IEC Wind Turbine Class IV\n\n   4.1.5 IEC Wind Turbine Class S\n\n   4.1.6 Turbulence characteristics\n\n   4.1.7 Mixed class (e.g., IEC Wind Turbine Class I / II)\n\n   4.1.8 Onshore\n\n   4.1.9 Offshore\n\n5. The entity may disclose additional materials weights that may represent significant materials costs, supply chain risks, or exposure to pricing volatility."}
