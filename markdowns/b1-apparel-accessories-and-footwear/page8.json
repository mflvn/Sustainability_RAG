Sustainability impacts related to climate change, land use, resource scarcity, and conflict in regions where the industry's supply chain operates are increasingly shaping the industry's ability to source materials. The ability of companies to manage potential materials shortages, supply disruptions, price volatility, and reputational risks is made more difficult by the fact that they source materials from geographically diverse regions through supply chains that often lack transparency. Failure to effectively manage this issue can lead to reduced margins, constrained revenue growth, and/or higher costs capital. The types of risk associated with sourcing different materials can require different solutions, including engaging with suppliers, enhancing transparency, using certification standards, and/or using innovative alternative materials. Companies that are most proactive are likely to reduce their exposure to price volatility and potential supply disruptions, while improving their brand reputation and developing new market opportunities.\n\n## Metrics\n\nCG-AA-440a.1.
