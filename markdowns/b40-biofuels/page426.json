{"page_number": 426, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Biofuels industry consists of companies that produce biofuels and process raw materials for production. Biofuels are manufactured using organic feedstocks and are used primarily as transportation fuels. Companies typically source feedstocks, which include food, oil crops, and animal products, from agricultural product distributors. Ethanol and biodiesel are the most widely produced biofuels, while other types include biogas, biohydrogen, and synthetic biofuels, produced from a variety of organic feedstocks. Biofuels companies' customers are chiefly fuel-blending and fuel-supply companies, including major integrated oil companies. While biofuels are produced worldwide, the publicly listed companies in the biofuels industry operate primarily in the U.S., though some have minor operations abroad, notably in India, Brazil, and South Korea. Government regulations related to the use of renewable fuel are a significant demand driver in the industry."}
