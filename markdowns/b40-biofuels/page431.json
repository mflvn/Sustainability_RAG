{"page_number": 431, "text_content": "# Lifecycle Emissions Balance\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nThe rapid growth in global biofuels production is due in large part to government energy policies that seek to reduce net GHG emissions from transportation fuels and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Most major renewable-fuel policies worldwide require that biofuels achieve lifecycle GHG emissions reductions relative to a fossil-fuel baseline to qualify for renewable fuel-mandate thresholds. The biofuel lifecycle emission calculation can include indirect and direct emissions from feedstock crop production and land use, fuel refining, fuel and feedstock transport, and vehicle exhaust emissions. Biofuel producers can directly influence net emissions during the refining process through energy management (fuel use), process innovations, and by using feedstocks with lower emissions profiles. Fuel products that achieve a reduction in net emissions can qualify as advanced biofuels, which, based on existing biofuels mandates in the U.S. and Europe, may be subject to increased demand in the future. Biofuel companies that cost-effectively reduce the net carbon emissions of their products may gain a competitive product advantage, leading to revenue growth and increased market share.\n\n## Metrics\n\nRR-BI-410a.1. Lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, by biofuel type\n\n1 The entity shall disclose its lifecycle GHG emissions (in grams of CO\u2082-e per megajoule) for each biofuel category it produces.\n\n1.1 Lifecycle GHG emissions are defined as the aggregate quantity of GHG emissions (including direct emissions and significant indirect emissions, such as significant emissions from land-use changes) related to the full fuel lifecycle, including all stages of fuel and feedstock production and distribution, from feedstock generation or extraction through the distribution and delivery of the finished fuel, to the ultimate consumer and use of the fuel, where the mass values for all GHGs are adjusted to account for their relative global warming potential.\n\n1.2 The entity shall disclose its lifecycle GHG emissions for each of the following biofuel types that it produces: (1) renewable fuel, (2) advanced biofuel, (3) biodiesel, and (4) cellulosic biofuel.\n\n1.2.1 Renewable fuel is defined as fuel derived from biomass.\n\n1.2.2 Advanced biofuel is defined as fuel derived from algae, animal manure, corn cobs, grape marcs and wine lees, nut shells, husks wastes and residues from forestry and forest-based industries, used cooking oil, etc.\n\n1.2.3 Biodiesel is defined as fuel derived from oils such as rape seeds, sunflowers, soybeans, palm oil, waste cooking oil, and used in place of diesel fuel."}
