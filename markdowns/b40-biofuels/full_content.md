# Industry Description

The Biofuels industry consists of companies that produce biofuels and process raw materials for production. Biofuels are manufactured using organic feedstocks and are used primarily as transportation fuels. Companies typically source feedstocks, which include food, oil crops, and animal products, from agricultural product distributors. Ethanol and biodiesel are the most widely produced biofuels, while other types include biogas, biohydrogen, and synthetic biofuels, produced from a variety of organic feedstocks. Biofuels companies' customers are chiefly fuel-blending and fuel-supply companies, including major integrated oil companies. While biofuels are produced worldwide, the publicly listed companies in the biofuels industry operate primarily in the U.S., though some have minor operations abroad, notably in India, Brazil, and South Korea. Government regulations related to the use of renewable fuel are a significant demand driver in the industry.

# Water Management in Manufacturing

## Topic Summary

Biofuel refining is typically water-intensive. Biorefineries require water for feedstock processing, fermentation, distillation, and cooling. Although water use at biorefineries is modest relative to the quantities consumed during feedstock crop production, it is concentrated, and thus may have impacts on local water resources. Facilities may also generate wastewater containing salts, organic compounds, dissolved solids, phosphorus, and other substances, requiring wastewater treatment. Biofuel refineries may also be exposed to the risk of reduced water availability and related cost increases or operational disruption. Extraction of water from certain areas for the purposes of refining, as well as contamination of water supplies due to refining operations, could also create regulatory risk and tensions with local communities. Water efficiency in operations and the proper treatment of effluents are therefore important factors for the performance of biofuels companies.

# Lifecycle Emissions Balance

## Topic Summary

The rapid growth in global biofuels production is due in large part to government energy policies that seek to reduce net GHG emissions from transportation fuels and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Most major renewable-fuel policies worldwide require that biofuels achieve lifecycle GHG emissions reductions relative to a fossil-fuel baseline to qualify for renewable fuel-mandate thresholds. The biofuel lifecycle emission calculation can include indirect and direct emissions from feedstock crop production and land use, fuel refining, fuel and feedstock transport, and vehicle exhaust emissions. Biofuel producers can directly influence net emissions during the refining process through energy management (fuel use), process innovations, and by using feedstocks with lower emissions profiles. Fuel products that achieve a reduction in net emissions can qualify as advanced biofuels, which, based on existing biofuels mandates in the U.S. and Europe, may be subject to increased demand in the future. Biofuel companies that cost-effectively reduce the net carbon emissions of their products may gain a competitive product advantage, leading to revenue growth and increased market share.

# Sourcing & Environmental Impacts of Feedstock Production

## Topic Summary

The Biofuels industry utilizes a variety of plant-based feedstocks as raw materials for production. Most companies purchase feedstocks from agricultural producers and distributors. A growing proportion of the world's arable land is now occupied by biofuel crops. Unsustainable cultivation practices can have negative environmental externalities, including deforestation and biodiversity loss, soil degradation, and water pollution. These factors could adversely affect feedstock crop yields over the short- and long-term. This, in turn, could influence the price and availability of feedstocks for biofuels producers. Consequently, vetting the sustainability of supply chains, such as through certifications or engagement with suppliers, is an important consideration for biofuels producers.

## Metrics

RR-BI-430a.1. Discussion of strategy to manage risks associated with environmental impacts of feedstock production

1. The entity shall discuss its strategy to manage the environmental impacts and regulatory risks associated with feedstock production, where risks may include, but are not limited to:

   1.1 Risks to feedstock supply and pricing created by climate change impacts such as increased likelihood of extreme weather events, decreased availability of clean water resources, increased competition for arable land, and decreased crop yields due to temperature increases.

   1.2 Long-term risks to feedstock supply associated with suppliers' impacts on environmental health including those on biodiversity and soil health that may be due to monoculture practices and/or fertilizer and pesticide use.

   1.3 Constraints created by regulation such as compliance with sustainability criteria in renewable fuel mandates (including RFS2 in the U.S. and the Renewable Energy Directive in the EU); potential regulatory limits on the types of land where feedstock can be grown; potential limits on what qualifies as renewable biomass; potential for reduction or loss of public or political support for biofuel mandates due to environmental impacts of feedstock production; and resistance to the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

2. The scope of this disclosure excludes risks associated with the lifecycle GHG emissions, which are addressed in RR-BI-410a.1, respectively.

3. If the entity identifies availability of clean water resources as a risk to feedstock supply and/or pricing, it shall discuss its vulnerability to feedstock growing regions with water stress and how it manages the risk of price variability due to sourcing feedstock from these regions.

   3.1 The entity should identify its known sources of feedstock from growing regions with High (40—80 percent) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress using the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.

#### Page 434

4 The entity shall describe its approach to managing risks and/or opportunities associated with feedstock production, including constraints created by regulation, and limits on availability and price.

4.1 Relevant strategies to discuss include sourcing from feedstock producers that are third-party certified to environmental sustainability standards, diversification of suppliers, using feedstock procurement criteria to choose suppliers for varied feedstocks with fewer environmental impacts or greater adaptability to the effects of environmental externalities (e.g., drought-tolerant or disease-resistant feedstocks), supplier audits, sourcing from regions where the entity has greater control over feedstock sources, and expenditures on research and development (R&D) for alternative and substitute feedstocks that are less susceptible to environmental externalities.

4.2 The entity should disclose the sustainability criteria it uses to assess its feedstock suppliers.

RR-BI-430a.2. Percentage of biofuel production third-party certified to an environmental sustainability standard

1 The entity shall calculate the percentage as the amount of biofuel produced, in gallons, that is third-party certified to an environmental sustainability standard divided by the total amount of biofuel produced (in gallons).

2 Environmental sustainability standards include Bonsucro, the Council on Sustainable Biomass Production (CSBP), International Sustainability & Carbon Certification, Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), and Roundtable on Responsible Soy (RTRS), as well as other standards with equivalent criteria.

2.1 At a minimum, standards should include the following environmental sustainability topics:

2.1.1 GHG and other air emissions, water consumption and quality, soil health, fertilizer and pesticide use, land-use change, biodiversity, and waste management.

3 The entity should disclose the certification schemes to which its biofuel is certified and the percentage of production certified to each scheme.

# Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment

## Topic Summary

The Biofuels industry is highly dependent on government policies and regulations, which create market demand and incentivize supply with tax breaks and other support for feedstock production. The Biofuels industry therefore supports certain regulations and policies related to renewable fuel policy, production tax credits, and feedstock production. While regulatory support can result in positive short-term gains by supporting the biofuels market, the potential long-term adverse environmental impacts from feedstock and biofuels production may result in a reversal of beneficial policies, leading to a more uncertain regulatory environment. Consequently, biofuels companies could benefit from developing a clear strategy for engaging regulators that is aligned with long-term sustainable business outcomes and that accounts for environmental externalities.
