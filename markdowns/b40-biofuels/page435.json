{"page_number": 435, "text_content": "# Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nThe Biofuels industry is highly dependent on government policies and regulations, which create market demand and incentivize supply with tax breaks and other support for feedstock production. The Biofuels industry therefore supports certain regulations and policies related to renewable fuel policy, production tax credits, and feedstock production. While regulatory support can result in positive short-term gains by supporting the biofuels market, the potential long-term adverse environmental impacts from feedstock and biofuels production may result in a reversal of beneficial policies, leading to a more uncertain regulatory environment. Consequently, biofuels companies could benefit from developing a clear strategy for engaging regulators that is aligned with long-term sustainable business outcomes and that accounts for environmental externalities.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### RR-BI-530a.1.
