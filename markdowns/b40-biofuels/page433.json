Most companies purchase feedstocks from agricultural producers and distributors. A growing proportion of the world's arable land is now occupied by biofuel crops. Unsustainable cultivation practices can have negative environmental externalities, including deforestation and biodiversity loss, soil degradation, and water pollution. These factors could adversely affect feedstock crop yields over the short- and long-term. This, in turn, could influence the price and availability of feedstocks for biofuels producers. Consequently, vetting the sustainability of supply chains, such as through certifications or engagement with suppliers, is an important consideration for biofuels producers.\n\n## Metrics\n\nRR-BI-430a.1. Discussion of strategy to manage risks associated with environmental impacts of feedstock production\n\n1. The entity shall discuss its strategy to manage the environmental impacts and regulatory risks associated with feedstock production, where risks may include, but are not limited to:\n\n   1.1 Risks to feedstock supply and pricing created by climate change impacts such as increased likelihood of extreme weather events, decreased availability of clean water resources, increased competition for arable land, and decreased crop yields due to temperature increases.\n\n   1.2 Long-term risks to feedstock supply associated with suppliers' impacts on environmental health including those on biodiversity and soil health that may be due to monoculture practices and/or fertilizer and pesticide use.\n\n   1.3 Constraints created by regulation such as compliance with sustainability criteria in renewable fuel mandates (including RFS2 in the U.S. and the Renewable Energy Directive in the EU); potential regulatory limits on the types of land where feedstock can be grown; potential limits on what qualifies as renewable biomass; potential for reduction or loss of public or political support for biofuel mandates due to environmental impacts of feedstock production; and resistance to the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\n\n2. The scope of this disclosure excludes risks associated with the lifecycle GHG emissions, which are addressed in RR-BI-410a.1, respectively.\n\n3. If the entity identifies availability of clean water resources as a risk to feedstock supply and/or pricing, it shall discuss its vulnerability to feedstock growing regions with water stress and how it manages the risk of price variability due to sourcing feedstock from these regions.\n\n   3.1 The entity should identify its known sources of feedstock from growing regions with High (40\u201480 percent) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress using the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct."}
