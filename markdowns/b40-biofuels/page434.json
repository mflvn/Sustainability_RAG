{"page_number": 434, "text_content": "4 The entity shall describe its approach to managing risks and/or opportunities associated with feedstock production, including constraints created by regulation, and limits on availability and price.\n\n4.1 Relevant strategies to discuss include sourcing from feedstock producers that are third-party certified to environmental sustainability standards, diversification of suppliers, using feedstock procurement criteria to choose suppliers for varied feedstocks with fewer environmental impacts or greater adaptability to the effects of environmental externalities (e.g., drought-tolerant or disease-resistant feedstocks), supplier audits, sourcing from regions where the entity has greater control over feedstock sources, and expenditures on research and development (R&D) for alternative and substitute feedstocks that are less susceptible to environmental externalities.\n\n4.2 The entity should disclose the sustainability criteria it uses to assess its feedstock suppliers.\n\nRR-BI-430a.2. Percentage of biofuel production third-party certified to an environmental sustainability standard\n\n1 The entity shall calculate the percentage as the amount of biofuel produced, in gallons, that is third-party certified to an environmental sustainability standard divided by the total amount of biofuel produced (in gallons).\n\n2 Environmental sustainability standards include Bonsucro, the Council on Sustainable Biomass Production (CSBP), International Sustainability & Carbon Certification, Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), and Roundtable on Responsible Soy (RTRS), as well as other standards with equivalent criteria.\n\n2.1 At a minimum, standards should include the following environmental sustainability topics:\n\n2.1.1 GHG and other air emissions, water consumption and quality, soil health, fertilizer and pesticide use, land-use change, biodiversity, and waste management.\n\n3 The entity should disclose the certification schemes to which its biofuel is certified and the percentage of production certified to each scheme."}
