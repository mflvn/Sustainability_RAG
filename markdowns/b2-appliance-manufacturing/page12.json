One key differentiating factor is the environmental impact of products over their lifecycle, which is often associated with the cost of using appliances. This issue involves a company's ability to design products with the entire lifecycle in mind, from creation and use to disposal. In particular, this covers energy and water efficiency in appliances, which account for a significant proportion of a home's energy and water use, as well as designing for and facilitating safe end-of-life disposal and recycling. Companies that prioritize designing and manufacturing products with improved environmental impacts are more likely to grow consumer demand and market share. Furthermore, companies that are able to minimize the environmental impacts of products are more likely to be better positioned to increased regulation related to areas such as extended producer responsibility.\n\n## Metrics\n\nCG-AM-410a.1.
