{"page_number": 188, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Agricultural Products industry is engaged in processing, trading, and distributing vegetables and fruits, and producing and milling agricultural commodities such as grains, sugar, consumable oils, maize, soybeans, and animal feed. Agricultural products are sold directly to consumers and to businesses for use in consumer and industrial products. Companies in the industry typically purchase agricultural products from entities that grow such products (either directly or indirectly) to then conduct value-adding activities (e.g., processing, trading, distributing, and milling). Agricultural products companies are also involved in wholesale and distribution. Companies in the industry may source a substantial portion of agricultural commodities from third-party growers in various countries. Therefore, managing sustainability risks within the supply chain is critical to securing a reliable supply of raw materials and reducing the risk of price increases and volatility over the long term.\n"}
