# Industry Description

The Agricultural Products industry is engaged in processing, trading, and distributing vegetables and fruits, and producing and milling agricultural commodities such as grains, sugar, consumable oils, maize, soybeans, and animal feed. Agricultural products are sold directly to consumers and to businesses for use in consumer and industrial products. Companies in the industry typically purchase agricultural products from entities that grow such products (either directly or indirectly) to then conduct value-adding activities (e.g., processing, trading, distributing, and milling). Agricultural products companies are also involved in wholesale and distribution. Companies in the industry may source a substantial portion of agricultural commodities from third-party growers in various countries. Therefore, managing sustainability risks within the supply chain is critical to securing a reliable supply of raw materials and reducing the risk of price increases and volatility over the long term.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Agricultural Products industry generate direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the processing and transportation of goods via land and sea freight operations. Emissions regulations may increase the cost of capital, operational costs, and affect the operational efficiency of companies that do not have strategies in place to manage GHG emissions. Employing innovative technologies that use alternative fuels and energy inputs—including biomass waste generated from internal processes—and improving fuel efficiency are ways companies can limit exposure to volatile fuel pricing, supply disruptions, future regulatory costs, and other potential consequences of GHG emissions.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Processing and milling agricultural products requires substantial energy input. While some agricultural products companies generate energy on-site through the direct combustion of fossil fuels and/or biomass, most energy is procured from the electrical grid. Energy consumption contributes to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. Energy management affects current and future costs of operation. Climate regulation and other sustainability factors could result in higher and/or more volatile electricity and fuel prices, increasing operating costs for agricultural products companies. Therefore, energy efficiency gained through process improvements can lower operating costs. The tradeoff between on-site versus grid-sourced electricity as well as the use of alternative energy can play important roles in influencing both the long-term cost and reliability of a company's energy supply and the extent of regulatory impact from direct versus indirect emissions.

## Metrics

For example, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed (excluding fleet vehicles) that was supplied from grid electricity.

2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed (excluding fleet vehicles) that is renewable energy.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

The Agricultural Products industry relies on water for processing activities, and companies in the industry also typically generate wastewater, or effluent. The availability of water, due to physical availability and/or regulatory access, directly impacts the industry's ability to efficiently operate processing facilities. Companies in the industry are increasingly exposed to water-related risks and regulations, which may increase capital expenditure costs, operating costs, remediation costs, and/or potential fines. Companies can manage water-related risks and opportunities and mitigate long-term costs through capital investments and assessment of facility locations relative to water scarcity risks, improvements to operational efficiency, and work with regulators and communities on issues related to water access and effluent. Risks related to crop production that are driven by water availability and access are addressed in a separate supply chain-oriented topic, Ingredient Sourcing.

# Ingredient Sourcing

## Topic Summary

Agricultural products companies source a wide variety of commodities and ingredients from farmers and/or intermediary distributors. The industry's ability to reliably source ingredients at desired price points fluctuates with crop yield, which may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management, and other resource scarcity considerations. Companies that source more productive and less resource-intensive crops, or those that work closely with suppliers to increase their adaptability to climate change and other resource scarcity risks, will be better protected from volatility in crop prices and from disruptions in crop supplies. Additionally, companies may improve their brand reputation and develop new market opportunities. Failure to effectively manage sourcing risks can lead to higher costs of capital, reduced margins, and constrained revenue growth.
