While some agricultural products companies generate energy on-site through the direct combustion of fossil fuels and/or biomass, most energy is procured from the electrical grid. Energy consumption contributes to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. Energy management affects current and future costs of operation. Climate regulation and other sustainability factors could result in higher and/or more volatile electricity and fuel prices, increasing operating costs for agricultural products companies. Therefore, energy efficiency gained through process improvements can lower operating costs. The tradeoff between on-site versus grid-sourced electricity as well as the use of alternative energy can play important roles in influencing both the long-term cost and reliability of a company's energy supply and the extent of regulatory impact from direct versus indirect emissions.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFB-AG-130a.1. (1) Operational energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable\n\n1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed (excluding fleet vehicles) as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n1.1 The scope of energy consumption excludes fuel consumed by fleet vehicles, but includes energy from all other sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.\n\n1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed (excluding fleet vehicles) that was supplied from grid electricity.\n\n2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed (excluding fleet vehicles) that is renewable energy.\n\n3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass."}
