Percentage of agricultural products sourced from regions with\nHigh or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1      The entity shall disclose the percentage of agricultural products sourced from\n       regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress.\n\n1.1    Agricultural products are defined as raw materials such as food, feed, and\n       biofuel ingredients that are sourced for use in the entity's operations.\n\n2      The percentage shall be calculated as the cost of agricultural products purchased\n       from Tier 1 suppliers that withdraw and consume water in regions with High or\n       Extremely High Baseline Water Stress for the production of the agricultural\n       products divided by the total cost of agricultural products purchased from Tier 1\n       suppliers.\n\n2.1    The entity shall identify Tier 1 suppliers that withdraw and consume\n       water in locations with High (40-80%) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline\n       Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water\n       Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.\n\n3      The scope of disclosure is agricultural products purchased from Tier 1 suppliers,\n       including those grown on a contract basis or sourced as a commodity.\n\n3.1    Tier 1 suppliers are defined as suppliers that transact directly with the\n       entity for agricultural products.\n\n3.2    Agricultural products grown on a contract basis include those for which\n       the entity has directly contracted the conditions of crop production and\n       the quality of crops with the farmer, consistent with the Food and\n       Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) \"Contract Farming\n       Resource Center.\""}
