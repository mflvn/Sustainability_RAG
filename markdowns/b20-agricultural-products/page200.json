The industry's ability to reliably source ingredients at desired price points fluctuates with crop yield, which may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management, and other resource scarcity considerations. Companies that source more productive and less resource-intensive crops, or those that work closely with suppliers to increase their adaptability to climate change and other resource scarcity risks, will be better protected from volatility in crop prices and from disruptions in crop supplies. Additionally, companies may improve their brand reputation and develop new market opportunities. Failure to effectively manage sourcing risks can lead to higher costs of capital, reduced margins, and constrained revenue growth.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFB-AG-440a.1. Identification of principal crops and description of risks and opportunities presented by climate change\n\n1 The entity shall identify any principal crops that are a priority to the entity's business.\n\n1.1 Principal crops are those crops that accounted for 10 percent or more of consolidated revenue in any of the last three reporting periods, as disclosed in FB-AG-000.A.\n\n2 The scope of disclosure shall include crops that are cultivated directly by the entity, grown on a contract basis, or sourced as a commodity.\n\n2.1 Crops cultivated directly by the entity include those grown on farms owned and/or operated by the entity.\n\n2.2 Crops grown on a contract basis include those for which the entity has directly contracted the conditions of crop production and the quality of crops with the farmer, consistent with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) \"Contract Farming Resource Center.\"\n\n2.3 Crops sourced as a commodity include those bought through the spot market, to-arrive bids, grain elevators, or other measures by which the entity is not able to control the production process.\n\n3 The entity shall describe the risks and/or opportunities that are presented to its principal crops by climate change scenarios, including, where relevant:\n\n3.1 Identification of the risks presented by climate change, including, but not limited to, availability of water, shifts in crop regions, pest migration, and extreme weather events\n\n3.2 Discussion of the scenarios used to determine the risks and opportunities presented by climate change"}
