{"page_number": 196, "text_content": "# Water Management\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nThe Agricultural Products industry relies on water for processing activities, and companies in the industry also typically generate wastewater, or effluent. The availability of water, due to physical availability and/or regulatory access, directly impacts the industry's ability to efficiently operate processing facilities. Companies in the industry are increasingly exposed to water-related risks and regulations, which may increase capital expenditure costs, operating costs, remediation costs, and/or potential fines. Companies can manage water-related risks and opportunities and mitigate long-term costs through capital investments and assessment of facility locations relative to water scarcity risks, improvements to operational efficiency, and work with regulators and communities on issues related to water access and effluent. Risks related to crop production that are driven by water availability and access are addressed in a separate supply chain-oriented topic, Ingredient Sourcing.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFB-AG-140a.1. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources.\n\n1.1 Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities.\n\n2 The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources.\n\n2.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n2.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.\n\n3.1 Water consumption is defined as:\n\n3.1.1 Water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge;\n\n3.1.2 Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service;\n\n3.1.3 Water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea."}
