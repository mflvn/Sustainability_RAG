While technological improvements have reduced the GHG emissions per ton of steel produced, steel production remains carbon-intensive relative to other industries. Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG emissions in response to the risks posed by climate change may result additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for iron and steel companies due to climate change mitigation policies. Operational efficiencies can be achieved through the cost-effective reduction of GHG emissions. Such efficiencies can mitigate the potential financial impact of increased fuel costs from regulations that seek to limit\u2014or put a price on\u2014GHG emissions.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-IS-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations\n\n1    The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).\n\n    1.1    Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).\n\n    1.2    Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.\n\n2    Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).\n\n    2.1    These emissions include direct emissions of GHGs from stationary or mobiles sources that include, but are not limited to, production facilities, office buildings, and iron and steel transportation (marine, road, and rail).\n\n    2.2    Acceptable calculation methodologies include those that conform to the GHG Protocol as the base reference, but provide additional guidance, such as industry- or region-specific guidance. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n        2.2.1    GHG Reporting Guidance for the Aerospace Industry published by International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG)"}
