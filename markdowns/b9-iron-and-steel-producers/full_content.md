# Industry Description

The Iron & Steel Producers industry consists of steel producers with iron and steel mills and companies with iron and steel foundries. The steel producers segment consists of companies that produce iron and steel products from their own mills. These products include flat-rolled sheets, tin plates, pipes, tubes, and products made of stainless steel, titanium, and high alloy steels. Iron and steel foundries, which cast various products, typically purchase iron and steel from other firms. The industry also includes metal service centers and other metal merchant wholesalers, which distribute, import, or export ferrous products. Steel production occurs via two primary methods: the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF), which uses iron ore as an input, and the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF), which uses scrap steel. Many companies in the industry operate on an international scale. Note: With a few exceptions, most companies do not mine their own ore to manufacture steel and iron products. There are separate SASB standards for the Metals & Mining (EM-MM) industry.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Iron and steel production generates significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily of carbon dioxide and methane, from production processes and on-site fuel combustion. While technological improvements have reduced the GHG emissions per ton of steel produced, steel production remains carbon-intensive relative to other industries. Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG emissions in response to the risks posed by climate change may result additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for iron and steel companies due to climate change mitigation policies. Operational efficiencies can be achieved through the cost-effective reduction of GHG emissions. Such efficiencies can mitigate the potential financial impact of increased fuel costs from regulations that seek to limit—or put a price on—GHG emissions.

## Metrics

EM-IS-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations

1    The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol—carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).

    1.1    Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

The production of steel requires significant quantities of energy, sourced primarily from the direct combustion of fossil fuels as well as energy purchased from the grid. Energy-intense production has implications for climate change and electricity purchases from the grid can result in indirect Scope 2 emissions. The choice between different production processes—electric arc furnaces and integrated basic oxygen furnace—can influence whether a company uses fossil fuels or purchases electricity. This decision, together with the choice between using coal versus natural gas or on-site versus grid-sourced electricity, can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of energy supply. Affordable, easily accessible, and reliable energy is an important competitive factor in this industry, with energy costs accounting for a substantial portion of manufacturing costs. The way in which an iron and steel company manages its overall energy efficiency, its reliance on different types of energy and associated sustainability risks, and its ability to access alternative sources of energy can influence its profitability.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Steel production requires a substantial amount of water. Companies face operational, regulatory, and reputational risks due to water scarcity, costs of water acquisition, regulations on effluents or amount of water used, and competition with local communities and other industries for limited water resources. This is the case especially in regions of water scarcity, due to potential water availability constraints and price volatility. Companies that are unable to secure a stable water supply could face production disruptions, while rising water prices could directly increase production costs. Consequently, the adoption of technologies and processes that reduce water consumption could lower operating risks and costs for companies by minimizing the impact of regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions on company operations.

## Metrics

EM-IS-140a.1. (1) Total fresh water withdrawn, (2) percentage recycled, (3) percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from freshwater sources:

1.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local statutes and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no regulatory definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1000 parts per million of dissolved solids.

1.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.

2 The entity shall disclose the percentage of water recycled as the volume, in thousands of cubic meters, recycled divided by the volume of water withdrawn.

2.1 Any volume of water reused multiple times shall be counted as recycled each time it is recycled and reused.

3 The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40-80%) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.

4 The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn.

5 The entity shall disclose its water consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water consumed.

# Supply Chain Management

## Topic Summary

Iron ore and coal are critical raw material inputs to the steel production process. Iron ore mining and coal production are resource-intensive processes. Extraction of these materials often has substantial environmental and social externalities affecting local communities, workers, and ecosystems. Such impacts can result in disruptions to mining operations due to community protests, legal or regulatory action, or increased costs of extraction as a result of regulatory compliance costs or penalties. Iron and steel companies could face disruptions as a result, or in some cases, may also be subject to regulatory penalties associated with the environmental or social impact of the mining company supplier. In order to minimize such risks, iron and steel producers may proactively manage their direct suppliers of critical raw materials to ensure that they are not engaged in illegal or otherwise environmentally or socially damaging practices, through appropriate supplier screening, monitoring, and engagement.

## Metrics

EM-IS-430a.1. Discussion of the process for managing iron ore and/or coking coal sourcing risks arising from environmental and social issues

1 The entity shall discuss its policies and procedures for managing environmental and social risks that may affect sourcing that are present in its iron ore and/or coking coal supply chain.

1.1 Discussion shall include any existing or projected risks or constraints in obtaining raw materials (e.g., iron ore, or coking coal) within the supply chain, including those related to restricted/limited availability, political situations, local labor conditions, natural disasters, climate change, or regulations.

1.2 The scope of disclosure may include description of the use of screening, codes of conduct, audits, and certifications.

2 If audits are discussed, the entity may indicate whether audits are internal (first party), independent (third party), or administered by peers (e.g., trade organizations).
