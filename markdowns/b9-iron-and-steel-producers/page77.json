{"page_number": 77, "text_content": "1.1 The calculation methodology for fuel consumed shall be based on actual fuel consumed as opposed to design parameters.\n\n1.2 Acceptable calculation methodologies for fuel consumed include, but are not limited to, methodologies based on:\n\n1.2.1 Adding fuel purchases made during the reporting period to beginning inventory at the start of the reporting period, less any fuel inventory at the end of the reporting period\n\n1.2.2 Tracking fuel consumed by vehicles\n\n1.2.3 Tracking fuel expenses\n\n2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of fuel consumed that is coal.\n\n2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as the amount of coal consumed (in GJ) divided by the total amount of fuel consumed (in GJ).\n\n2.2 The scope of coal consumed includes, but is not limited to, thermal coal, metallurgical coal, coke, and coke breeze.\n\n3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of fuel consumed that is natural gas.\n\n3.1 The percentage shall be calculated as the amount of natural gas consumed (in GJ) divided by the total amount of fuel consumed (in GJ).\n\n4 The entity shall disclose (4) the percentage of fuel consumed that is renewable fuel.\n\n4.1 Renewable fuel is generally defined, as fuel that meets all of the following requirements:\n\n4.1.1 Produced from renewable biomass;\n\n4.1.2 Used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel present in a transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel; and\n\n4.1.3 Achieved net lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction on a lifecycle basis.\n\n4.2 The entity shall disclose the standard or regulation used to determine if a fuel is renewable.\n\n4.3 The percentage shall be calculated as the amount of renewable fuel consumed (in GJ) divided by the total amount of fuel consumed (in GJ).\n\n5 In calculating energy consumption from fuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."}
