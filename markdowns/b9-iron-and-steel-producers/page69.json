{"page_number": 69, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Iron & Steel Producers industry consists of steel producers with iron and steel mills and companies with iron and steel foundries. The steel producers segment consists of companies that produce iron and steel products from their own mills. These products include flat-rolled sheets, tin plates, pipes, tubes, and products made of stainless steel, titanium, and high alloy steels. Iron and steel foundries, which cast various products, typically purchase iron and steel from other firms. The industry also includes metal service centers and other metal merchant wholesalers, which distribute, import, or export ferrous products. Steel production occurs via two primary methods: the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF), which uses iron ore as an input, and the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF), which uses scrap steel. Many companies in the industry operate on an international scale. Note: With a few exceptions, most companies do not mine their own ore to manufacture steel and iron products. There are separate SASB standards for the Metals & Mining (EM-MM) industry."}
