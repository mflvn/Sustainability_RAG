Companies face operational, regulatory, and reputational risks due to water scarcity, costs of water acquisition, regulations on effluents or amount of water used, and competition with local communities and other industries for limited water resources. This is the case especially in regions of water scarcity, due to potential water availability constraints and price volatility. Companies that are unable to secure a stable water supply could face production disruptions, while rising water prices could directly increase production costs. Consequently, the adoption of technologies and processes that reduce water consumption could lower operating risks and costs for companies by minimizing the impact of regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions on company operations.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-IS-140a.1. (1) Total fresh water withdrawn, (2) percentage recycled, (3) percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from freshwater sources:\n\n1.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local statutes and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no regulatory definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n1.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose the percentage of water recycled as the volume, in thousands of cubic meters, recycled divided by the volume of water withdrawn.\n\n2.1 Any volume of water reused multiple times shall be counted as recycled each time it is recycled and reused.\n\n3 The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40-80%) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.\n\n4 The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn.\n\n5 The entity shall disclose its water consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water consumed."}
