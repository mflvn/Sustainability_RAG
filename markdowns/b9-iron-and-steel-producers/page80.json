Iron ore mining and coal production are resource-intensive processes. Extraction of these materials often has substantial environmental and social externalities affecting local communities, workers, and ecosystems. Such impacts can result in disruptions to mining operations due to community protests, legal or regulatory action, or increased costs of extraction as a result of regulatory compliance costs or penalties. Iron and steel companies could face disruptions as a result, or in some cases, may also be subject to regulatory penalties associated with the environmental or social impact of the mining company supplier. In order to minimize such risks, iron and steel producers may proactively manage their direct suppliers of critical raw materials to ensure that they are not engaged in illegal or otherwise environmentally or socially damaging practices, through appropriate supplier screening, monitoring, and engagement.\n\n## Metrics\n\nEM-IS-430a.1. Discussion of the process for managing iron ore and/or coking coal sourcing risks arising from environmental and social issues\n\n1 The entity shall discuss its policies and procedures for managing environmental and social risks that may affect sourcing that are present in its iron ore and/or coking coal supply chain.\n\n1.1 Discussion shall include any existing or projected risks or constraints in obtaining raw materials (e.g., iron ore, or coking coal) within the supply chain, including those related to restricted/limited availability, political situations, local labor conditions, natural disasters, climate change, or regulations.\n\n1.2 The scope of disclosure may include description of the use of screening, codes of conduct, audits, and certifications.\n\n2 If audits are discussed, the entity may indicate whether audits are internal (first party), independent (third party), or administered by peers (e.g., trade organizations)."}
