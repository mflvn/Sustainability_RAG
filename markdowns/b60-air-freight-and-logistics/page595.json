{"text_content": "4 In disclosing fuel consumed by (2) air transport-related operations, the entity shall additionally disclose the percentage of fuel consumed that is (a) alternative fuel.\n\n4.1 Alternative fuel is defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as fuel from sources other than petroleum that has the potential to generate lower carbon emissions than petroleum-based fuel on a life cycle basis.\n\n4.2 The percentage shall be calculated as the amount of alternative fuel consumed by air transport-related operations (in GJ) divided by the total amount of fuel consumed by air transport-related operations (in GJ).\n\n5 In disclosing fuel consumed by (2) air transport-related operations, the entity shall additionally disclose the percentage of fuel consumed that was (b) sustainable fuel.\n\n5.1 Sustainable fuel is defined as a subset of alternative fuel that meets all of the following criteria described by ICAO:\n\n5.1.1 Achieves net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction on a life cycle basis;\n\n5.1.2 Avoids competition with food and water through utilization of marginal or unviable land; and\n\n5.1.3 Contributes to local social and economic development, such as through expanded employment and revitalized infrastructure.\n\n5.2 The percentage shall be calculated as the amount of sustainable fuel consumed by air transport-related operations (in GJ) divided by the total amount of fuel consumed by air transport-related operations (in GJ).\n\n6 The scope of disclosure is limited to fuel directly consumed by the entity.\n\n7 In calculating energy consumption from fuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\n8 The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels).", "page_number": 595}
