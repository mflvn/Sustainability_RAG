Fuel consumed by (1) road transport, percentage (a) natural gas and (b) renewable, and (2) air transport, percentage (a) alternative and (b) sustainable\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the amount of fuel consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ), broken down by (1) road transport-related operations, and separately, (2) air transport-related operations.\n\n1.1 The calculation methodology for fuel consumed shall be based on actual fuel consumed as opposed to design parameters.\n\n1.2 Acceptable calculation methodologies for fuel consumed include, but are not limited to, methodologies based on:\n\n1.2.1 Adding fuel purchases made during the reporting period to beginning inventory at the start of the reporting period, less any fuel inventory at the end of the reporting period\n\n1.2.2 Tracking fuel consumed by vehicles\n\n1.2.3 Tracking fuel expenses\n\n2 In disclosing fuel consumed by (1) road transport-related operations, the entity shall additionally disclose the percentage of fuel consumed that is (a) natural gas.\n\n2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as the amount of fuel consumed by road transport-related operations that was natural gas (in GJ) divided by the total amount of fuel consumed by road transport-related operations (in GJ).\n\n3 In disclosing fuel consumed by (1) road transport-related operations, the entity shall additionally disclose the percentage of fuel consumed that is (b) renewable fuel.\n\n3.1 Renewable fuel is generally defined as fuel that meets all of the following requirements:\n\n3.1.1 Produced from renewable biomass;\n\n3.1.2 Used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel present in a transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel; and\n\n3.1.3 Achieved net Has lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction on a life cycle basis that are at least 20 percent less than baseline lifecycle GHG emissions, unless the fuel is exempt from this requirement pursuant to U.S. 40 CFR 80.1403.\n\n3.2 The entity shall disclose the standard or regulation used to determine if a fuel is renewable.\n\n3.3 The percentage shall be calculated as the amount of renewable fuel consumed by road transport-related operations (in GJ) divided by the total amount of fuel consumed by road transport-related operations (in GJ)."}
