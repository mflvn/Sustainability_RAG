{"page_number": 596, "text_content": "# Supply Chain Management\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nMany companies in the Air Freight & Logistics industry contract with large, complex networks of asset-based third-party providers to provide freight transportation services to their customers. Contracting is especially common among companies providing freight forwarding, logistics, brokerage, and intermodal services. These contractors range across all modes of transport such as motor carriers, railroads, air freight, and ocean carriers. Companies need to manage the relationships with their contractors in order to ensure that contractor actions that lead to environmental or social impacts do not result in material adverse effects on their own operations, such as decreased brand value. At the same time, companies that are able to offer low-carbon logistics solutions may capture market share from customers seeking to reduce the carbon footprint of their shipments.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### TR-AF-430a.1. Percentage of carriers with BASIC percentiles above the FMCSA intervention threshold\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of carriers the entity contracts with that have one or more U.S. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Category (BASIC) percentiles over the Intervention Threshold.\n\n1.1 The percentage shall be calculated as the number of carriers the entity contracts with that have one or more BASIC percentiles over the Intervention Threshold divided by the total number of carriers the entity contracts with.\n\n2 The scope of disclosure includes carriers with which the entity has contracted for transportation services during the reporting period.\n\n### TR-AF-430a.2. Total greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint across transport modes\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the complete tank-to-wheels greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint in metric tons of CO2-e per metric ton-kilometer.\n\n2 Tank-to-wheels emissions relate to vehicle processes and exclude upstream emissions associated with primary energy production (i.e., well-to-tank emissions).\n\n2.1 The entity shall calculate its disclosure according to EN 16258:2012, Methodology for calculation and declaration of energy consumption and GHG emissions of transport services (freight and passengers).\n\n2.1.1 Calculations shall be consistent with the methodology used to calculate the \"tank-to-wheels GHG emissions (Gt)\" result that is described in EN 16258:2012.\n\n2.1.2 Determination of transportation system scope, boundaries, and any necessary allocations shall be consistent with the methodology described in EN 16258:2012."}
