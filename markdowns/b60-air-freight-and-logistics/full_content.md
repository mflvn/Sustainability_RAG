# Industry Description

Air freight and logistics companies provide freight services and transportation logistics to both businesses and individuals. There are three main industry segments: air freight transportation, post and courier services, and transportation logistics services. Companies in the industry earn revenue from one or more of the segments and range from non-asset-based to asset-heavy. Transportation logistics services include contracting with road, rail, marine, and air freight companies to select and hire appropriate transportation. Services can also include customs brokerage, distribution management, vendor consolidation, cargo insurance, purchase-order management, and customized logistics information. The industry is key to global trade, granting it a degree of demand stability.

---

110 Note to TR-AF-000.A – Revenue ton kilometers (RTK) is defined as one metric ton of revenue traffic transported one kilometer. RTK is computed by multiplying the vehicle-kilometers traveled on each leg by the number of tons of revenue traffic carried on that leg.

111 Note to TR-AF-000.B – Load factor is a measure of capacity utilization and is calculated as kilometers traveled by cargo divided by total kilometers traveled.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Air Freight & Logistics industry generate direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change. Emissions are generated from fuel combustion by both air and road freight operations. Given the altitude of the emissions from jet fuel, air freight makes an especially potent contribution to climate change. Management of GHG emissions is likely to affect air freight and logistics companies' cost structure over time, as emissions are tied directly to fuel use, and thus to operating expenses. Fuel efficiency and the use of alternative fuels offers a way for companies to reduce fuel costs and/or limit exposure to volatile fuel pricing, future regulatory costs, and other consequences of GHG emissions. While newer aircraft and trucks are generally more fuel-efficient, existing fleets may be retrofitted. Capital investments in more fuel-efficient airplanes and/or vehicles and emerging fuel-management technology may potentially reduce ongoing fuel expenses and improve profitability. It can also help companies potentially capture market share of customers seeking low-carbon shipping solutions.

# Supply Chain Management

## Topic Summary

Many companies in the Air Freight & Logistics industry contract with large, complex networks of asset-based third-party providers to provide freight transportation services to their customers. Contracting is especially common among companies providing freight forwarding, logistics, brokerage, and intermodal services. These contractors range across all modes of transport such as motor carriers, railroads, air freight, and ocean carriers. Companies need to manage the relationships with their contractors in order to ensure that contractor actions that lead to environmental or social impacts do not result in material adverse effects on their own operations, such as decreased brand value. At the same time, companies that are able to offer low-carbon logistics solutions may capture market share from customers seeking to reduce the carbon footprint of their shipments.

## Metrics
