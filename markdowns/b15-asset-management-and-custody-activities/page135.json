{"text_content": "# Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Investment Management & Advisory\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nAsset management and custody activities companies maintain a fiduciary responsibility to their clients. These companies must therefore consider and incorporate an analysis of all material information into investment decisions, including environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. The process of ESG incorporation involves consideration of ESG factors in valuation, modeling, portfolio construction, proxy voting, and engagement with investees and, as a result, in investment decision-making by asset and wealth managers. As the management and use of non-financial forms of capital increasingly contribute to market value, incorporation of ESG factors in analysis of investees has become more relevant. Research has established that a company's management of certain ESG factors can materially impact both its accounting and market returns. Therefore, deep understanding of investees' ESG performance, integration of ESG factors in valuation and modeling, as well as engagement with investees on sustainability issues allows asset managers to generate superior returns. On the other hand, asset management and custody activities companies that fail to consider these risks and opportunities in their investment management activities could see diminished investment returns in their portfolios which would lead to reduced performance fees. Over the long term, it could result in outflow of assets under management (AUM) resulting in the loss of market share and lower management fees.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFN-AC-410a.1.
