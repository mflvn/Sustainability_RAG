# Industry Description

The Asset Management & Custody Activities industry is comprised of companies that manage investment portfolios on a commission or fee basis for institutional, retail, and high net-worth investors. In addition, firms in this industry provide wealth management, private banking, financial planning, and investment advisory and retail securities brokerage services. Investment portfolios and strategies may be diversified across multiple asset classes, which include, but are not limited to, equities, fixed income, and hedge fund investments. Specific companies are engaged in venture capital and private equity investments. The industry provides an essential service in assisting a range of customers from individual retail investors to large, institutional asset owners to meet specified investment goals. Companies in the industry range from large multinational asset managers with a wide range of investable products, strategies, and asset classes to small boutique firms providing services to a very specific market niche. While large firms generally compete on the basis of management fees charged for their services as well as their potential to generate superior investment performance, the smaller firms generally compete on their ability to provide products and services geared towards individual clients to satisfy their diversification needs. The 2008 financial crisis and subsequent regulatory developments highlight the social impact of the industry in terms of providing fair advice to customers and managing risks at the entity, portfolio, and economy-wide levels.

# Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Investment Management & Advisory

## Topic Summary

Asset management and custody activities companies maintain a fiduciary responsibility to their clients. These companies must therefore consider and incorporate an analysis of all material information into investment decisions, including environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. The process of ESG incorporation involves consideration of ESG factors in valuation, modeling, portfolio construction, proxy voting, and engagement with investees and, as a result, in investment decision-making by asset and wealth managers. As the management and use of non-financial forms of capital increasingly contribute to market value, incorporation of ESG factors in analysis of investees has become more relevant. Research has established that a company's management of certain ESG factors can materially impact both its accounting and market returns. Therefore, deep understanding of investees' ESG performance, integration of ESG factors in valuation and modeling, as well as engagement with investees on sustainability issues allows asset managers to generate superior returns. On the other hand, asset management and custody activities companies that fail to consider these risks and opportunities in their investment management activities could see diminished investment returns in their portfolios which would lead to reduced performance fees. Over the long term, it could result in outflow of assets under management (AUM) resulting in the loss of market share and lower management fees.

# Transition Risk Exposure

## Topic Summary

Asset management and custody activities entities maintain a fiduciary responsibility to their clients and therefore consider all material information in their investment decisions. Transition risks and opportunities stemming from, for example, policy change, emerging regulation or technological innovation, are becoming more prevalent and are therefore increasingly being factored into investment decision making. A core component of identifying and assessing these risks and opportunities is the ability to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of investment portfolios, a concept commonly referred to as 'financed emissions.' Failure to manage this risk could result in diminished investment returns in an asset manager's investment portfolios, which in turn may lead to reduced performance fees. Over the long term, mismanagement of this risk could precipitate an outflow of assets under management (AUM) resulting in the loss of market share and lower revenue . On the other hand, investment opportunities may arise from effective management of this risk, leading to increased performance and fee income from increased AUM, thus strengthening market share.
