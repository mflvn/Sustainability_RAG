{"page_number": 141, "text_content": "# Transition Risk Exposure\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nAsset management and custody activities entities maintain a fiduciary responsibility to their clients and therefore consider all material information in their investment decisions. Transition risks and opportunities stemming from, for example, policy change, emerging regulation or technological innovation, are becoming more prevalent and are therefore increasingly being factored into investment decision making. A core component of identifying and assessing these risks and opportunities is the ability to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of investment portfolios, a concept commonly referred to as 'financed emissions.' Failure to manage this risk could result in diminished investment returns in an asset manager's investment portfolios, which in turn may lead to reduced performance fees. Over the long term, mismanagement of this risk could precipitate an outflow of assets under management (AUM) resulting in the loss of market share and lower revenue . On the other hand, investment opportunities may arise from effective management of this risk, leading to increased performance and fee income from increased AUM, thus strengthening market share.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### FN-AC-1. Percentage of total assets under management (AUM) included in the financed emissions calculation\n\n1 The entity will disclose the percentage of AUM included in the financed emissions calculation.\n\n1.1 AUM shall be defined broadly as the total market value, expressed in the entity's presentation currency, of the assets managed by a financial institution on behalf of clients.\n\n1.2 The entity shall calculate the percentage by dividing the AUM included in the financed emissions calculation by total AUM.\n\n1.2.1 If less than 100%, the entity will provide an explanation for exclusions including type of assets and associated amount of AUM expressed in the entity's presentation currency.\n\n### FN-AC-2. (1) Absolute gross (a) Scope 1 emissions, (b) Scope 2 emissions, and (c) Scope 3 emissions, and (2) associated amount of total AUM (i.e., financed emissions)\n\n1 The entity shall disclose its absolute gross financed emissions, disaggregated by Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions.\n\n1.1 Financed emissions refers to the portion of gross emissions of the investee attributed to the investments made by the entity on behalf of a third party which falls under Scope 3: category 15 (investments) in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard.\n\n1.2 Absolute gross emissions are defined as the total quantity of Scope 1 emissions, Scope 2 emissions and Scope 3 emissions expressed in metric tons of CO\u2082 equivalent (i.e., mt CO\u2082-e)."}
