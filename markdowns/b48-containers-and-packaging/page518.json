Companies face regulatory and operational challenges in managing waste, as some wastes are subject to regulations pertaining to its transport, treatment, storage, and disposal. Waste management strategies include reduced generation, effective treatment and disposal, and recycling and recovery, where possible. Such activities, while requiring initial investment or operating costs, can lower companies' long-term cost structure and mitigate the risk of remediation liabilities or regulatory penalties.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### RT-CP-150a.1. Amount of hazardous waste generated, percentage recycled\n\n1. The entity shall calculate and disclose the total amount of hazardous waste generated, in metric tons.\n\n   1.1 Hazardous wastes are defined per the legal or regulatory framework(s) applicable within the jurisdiction(s) where the waste is generated.\n\n2. The entity shall calculate and disclose the percentage of hazardous waste recycled as the total weight of hazardous waste generated that was recycled, divided by the total weight of hazardous waste generated.\n\n   2.1 Hazardous waste that is reused, reclaimed, and/or remanufactured shall be considered within the scope of recycled.\n\n   2.2 Recycled, reused, reclaimed, and remanufactured hazardous waste is defined per the legal or regulatory framework(s) applicable within the jurisdiction where the waste is generated.\n\n   2.3 Materials incinerated, including for energy recovery, shall not be considered within the scope of recycled.\n\n      2.3.1 Energy recovery is defined as the use of combustible waste as a means to generate energy through direct incineration, with or without other waste, but with recovery of the heat.\n\n      2.3.2 The entity may separately disclose the percentage of hazardous waste generated that was incinerated.\n\n3. The entity may use the U.S. Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) or the EU Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, including its subsequent amendments), for the purposes of defining hazardous waste and/or recycled hazardous waste for operations located in jurisdictions that lack applicable legal or regulatory definitions.\n\nNote to RT-CP-150a.1\n\n1. The entity shall disclose the legal or regulatory framework(s) used to define hazardous waste and recycled hazardous waste, and the amounts defined in accordance with each applicable framework."}
