# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Topic Summary

The Containers & Packaging industry generates direct (Scope 1) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in manufacturing and cogeneration processes. GHG emissions can create regulatory compliance costs or penalties and operating risks for companies in the industry. However, resulting financial impacts will vary depending on the magnitude of emissions and the prevailing emissions regulations. The industry may be subject to increasingly stringent regulations as nations seek to limit or reduce emissions. Companies that cost-effectively manage GHG emissions through greater energy efficiency, the use of alternative fuels, or manufacturing process advances could benefit from improved operating efficiency and reduced regulatory risk, among other financial benefits.

## Metrics

RT-CP-110a.1. Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations

1 The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol—carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).

1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e), and calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP values is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014).

1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.

2 Scope 1 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Containers and packaging manufacturing is energy-intensive, with energy used to power processing units, cogeneration plants, machinery, and non-manufacturing facilities. The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and energy management strategies depend on the type of products manufactured. Typically, fossil fuels such as natural gas and biomass are the predominant form of energy used, while purchased electricity may also represent a significant share. Therefore, energy purchases can represent a significant share of production costs. A company's energy mix may include energy generated onsite, purchased grid electricity and fossil fuels, and renewable and alternative energy. Trade-offs in the use of such energy sources include cost, reliability of supply, related water use and air emissions, and regulatory compliance and risk. As such, a company's energy intensity and energy sourcing decisions can affect its operating efficiency and risk profile over time.

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Containers and packaging manufacturing requires water for various stages of production, including in raw-materials processing, process cooling, and steam generation at onsite cogeneration plants. Long-term historic increases in water scarcity and cost, and expectations of continued increases—due to overconsumption and constrained supplies, resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution, and climate change—indicate the heightened importance of water management. Water scarcity can result in a higher risk of operational disruption for companies with water-intensive operations and can also increase water procurement costs and capital expenditures. Meanwhile, containers and packaging manufacturing can generate process wastewater that must be treated before disposal. Non-compliance with water quality regulations may result in regulatory compliance and mitigation costs or legal expenses stemming from litigation. Reducing water use and consumption through increased efficiency and other water management strategies can lead to lower operating costs over time and can mitigate financial impacts of regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions of operations.

# Waste Management

## Topic Summary

Containers and packaging manufacturing may generate hazardous process waste, including, but not limited to, heavy metals, spent acids, catalysts, and wastewater treatment sludge. Companies face regulatory and operational challenges in managing waste, as some wastes are subject to regulations pertaining to its transport, treatment, storage, and disposal. Waste management strategies include reduced generation, effective treatment and disposal, and recycling and recovery, where possible. Such activities, while requiring initial investment or operating costs, can lower companies' long-term cost structure and mitigate the risk of remediation liabilities or regulatory penalties.

## Metrics

3. The entity may use the U.S. Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) or the EU Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, including its subsequent amendments), for the purposes of defining hazardous waste and/or recycled hazardous waste for operations located in jurisdictions that lack applicable legal or regulatory definitions.

Note to RT-CP-150a.1

1. The entity shall disclose the legal or regulatory framework(s) used to define hazardous waste and recycled hazardous waste, and the amounts defined in accordance with each applicable framework.

#### Page 519

1.1    For example, if the entity's operations fall under the jurisdiction of the EU Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, including its subsequent amendments), and therefore, the Waste Framework Directive was used to define all hazardous waste and recycled hazardous waste, the entity shall specify this in its disclosures of the amount of hazardous waste generated and the percentage recycled.

#### Page 520

# Supply Chain Management

## Topic Summary

Containers and packaging manufacturing utilizes large quantities of raw materials including wood fiber and aluminum. Sustainable production of these materials is an important supply chain consideration for companies in the industry, as adverse environmental impacts could increase materials costs and affect the brand value of containers and packaging companies. In order to mitigate such risks, companies can implement supply chain vetting practices and implement third-party standards within internal operations and suppliers that certify that the materials they procure were produced in a sustainable manner. Additionally, such actions can raise brand value and meet customer demand for sustainably produced packaging products, providing access to new markets and growth opportunities.
