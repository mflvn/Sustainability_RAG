{"text_content": "# Energy Management\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nContainers and packaging manufacturing is energy-intensive, with energy used to power processing units, cogeneration plants, machinery, and non-manufacturing facilities. The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and energy management strategies depend on the type of products manufactured. Typically, fossil fuels such as natural gas and biomass are the predominant form of energy used, while purchased electricity may also represent a significant share. Therefore, energy purchases can represent a significant share of production costs. A company's energy mix may include energy generated onsite, purchased grid electricity and fossil fuels, and renewable and alternative energy. Trade-offs in the use of such energy sources include cost, reliability of supply, related water use and air emissions, and regulatory compliance and risk. As such, a company's energy intensity and energy sourcing decisions can affect its operating efficiency and risk profile over time.\n\n## Metrics\n\nRT-CP-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable, (4) total self-generated energy\n\n1    The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n1.1    The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.\n\n1.2    The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.\n\n1.3    In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n2    The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.\n\n2.1    The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.\n\n3    The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.\n\n3.1    Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.\n\n3.2    The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.", "page_number": 512}
