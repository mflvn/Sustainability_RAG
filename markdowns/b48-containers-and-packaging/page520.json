{"page_number": 520, "text_content": "# Supply Chain Management\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nContainers and packaging manufacturing utilizes large quantities of raw materials including wood fiber and aluminum. Sustainable production of these materials is an important supply chain consideration for companies in the industry, as adverse environmental impacts could increase materials costs and affect the brand value of containers and packaging companies. In order to mitigate such risks, companies can implement supply chain vetting practices and implement third-party standards within internal operations and suppliers that certify that the materials they procure were produced in a sustainable manner. Additionally, such actions can raise brand value and meet customer demand for sustainably produced packaging products, providing access to new markets and growth opportunities.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### RT-CP-430a.1. Total wood fiber procured, percentage from certified sources\n\n1. The entity shall disclose the total weight (in metric tons) of wood-fiber-based raw materials procured during the reporting period.\n\n   1.1 The scope of raw materials includes all inputs that are processed to be sold as a finished good, including recycled raw materials, virgin raw materials, and goods that will be consumed directly in the production process.\n\n2. The percentage shall be calculated as the total weight (in metric tons) of its wood-fiber-based raw materials that are certified to a responsible sourcing standard divided by the total weight (in metric tons) of wood-fiber-based raw materials, where responsible sourcing certifications include those promulgated by the following organizations (or the equivalent):\n\n   2.1 American Tree Farm System (ATFS)\n\n   2.2 Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) (i.e., FSC 100% label and FSC Mixed Sources and FSC Recycled labels)\n\n   2.3 Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) (i.e., PEFC Certified and PEFC Recycled labels)\n\n   2.4 Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI) (i.e., SFI Chain of Custody and SFI Certified Sourcing labels)\n\n3. The entity may disclose separately the percent of fiber that is certified to each relevant responsible sourcing standard (e.g., FSC, SFI, PEFC, and ATFS) and relevant standards (e.g., FSC 100% label, FSC Mixed Sources and FSC Recycled labels, SFI Chain of Custody and SFI Certified Sourcing labels, and PEFC Certified and PEFC Recycled labels).\n\n4. For fiber that is certified to multiple schemes, the entity shall not account for the fiber weight more than once."}
