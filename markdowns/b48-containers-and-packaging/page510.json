{"page_number": 510, "text_content": "5 In the case that current reporting of GHG emissions to the CDP or other entity (e.g., a national regulatory disclosure program) differs in terms of the scope and consolidation approach used, the entity may disclose those emissions. However, primary disclosure shall be according to the guidelines described above.\n\n6 The entity may discuss the calculation methodology for its emissions disclosure, such as if data are from continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS), engineering calculations, or mass balance calculations.\n\nRT-CP-110a.2. Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets\n\n1 The entity shall discuss its long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage its Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\n1.1 Scope 1 emissions are defined according to The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition (GHG Protocol), March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).\n\n1.2 The scope of GHG emissions includes the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083).\n\n2 The entity shall discuss its emission reduction target(s) and analyze its performance against the target(s), including the following, where relevant:\n\n2.1 The scope of the emission reduction target (e.g., the percentage of total emissions to which the target is applicable);\n\n2.2 Whether the target is absolute- or intensity-based, and the metric denominator, if it is an intensity-based target;\n\n2.3 The percentage reduction against the base year, with the base year representing the first year against which emissions are evaluated toward the achievement of the target;\n\n2.4 The timelines for the reduction activity, including the start year, the target year, and the base year;\n\n2.5 The mechanism(s) for achieving the target; and\n\n2.6 Any circumstances in which the target or base year emissions have been, or may be, recalculated retrospectively or the target or base year has been reset.\n\n3 The entity shall discuss the activities and investments required to achieve the plans and/or targets, and any risks or limiting factors that might affect achievement of the plans and/or targets.\n\n4 The entity shall discuss the scope of its strategies, plans, and/or reduction targets, such as how they relate to different business units, geographies, or emissions sources."}
