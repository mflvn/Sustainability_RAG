{"page_number": 207, "text_content": "4 The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40\u201380 percent) or Extremely High (>80 percent) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.\n\n5 The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn.\n\n6 The entity shall disclose its water consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water consumed.\n\n## FB-AB-140a.2. Description of water management risks and discussion of strategies and practices to mitigate those risks\n\n1 The entity shall describe its water management risks associated with water withdrawals, water consumption, and discharge of water and/or wastewater.\n\n1.1 Risks associated with water withdrawals and water consumption include risks to the availability of adequate, clean water resources, including, but not limited to:\n\n1.1.1 Environmental constraints\u2014such as operating in water-stressed regions, drought, concerns of aquatic impingement or entrainment, interannual or seasonal variability, and risks due to the impact of climate change\n\n1.1.2 Regulatory and financial constraints\u2014such as volatility in water costs, stakeholder perceptions and concerns related to water withdrawals (e.g., those from local communities, non-governmental organizations, and regulatory agencies), direct competition with and impact from the actions of other users (e.g., commercial and municipal users), restrictions to withdrawals due to regulations, and constraints on the entity's ability to obtain and retain water rights or permits\n\n1.2 Risks associated with the discharge of water and/or wastewater, include, but are not limited to, the ability to obtain rights or permits related to discharges, compliance with regulations related to discharges, restrictions to discharges, the ability to maintain control over the temperature of water discharges, liabilities and/or reputational risks, and increased operating costs due to regulation, stakeholder perceptions and concerns related to water discharges (e.g., those from local communities, non-governmental organizations, and regulatory agencies).\n\n2 The entity may describe water management risks in the context of:\n\n2.1 How risks may vary by withdrawal source, including surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities; and\n\n2.2 How risks may vary by discharge destinations, including surface water, groundwater, or wastewater utilities."}
