{"text_content": "# Environmental & Social Impacts of Ingredient Supply Chain\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nCompanies in the Alcoholic Beverages industry manage global supply chains to source a wide range of ingredient inputs. How companies screen, monitor, and engage with suppliers on environmental and social topics affects companies' ability to secure supply and manage price fluctuations. Supply chain interruption can cause loss of revenue and negatively impact market share if companies are not able to find alternatives for key suppliers or have to source ingredients at higher cost. Supply chain management issues related to labor practices, environmental responsibility, ethics or corruption may also result in regulatory fines and/or increased long-term operational costs. The consumer-facing nature of the industry increases the reputational risks associated with supplier actions. Managing a company's exposure to environmental and social risks can lead to improved supply chain resiliency and enhanced reputation. Companies can engage with key suppliers to manage environmental and social risks to improve supply chain resiliency, mitigate reputational risks, and potentially increase consumer demand or capture new market opportunities.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFB-AB-430a.1. Suppliers' social and environmental responsibility audit (1) non-conformance rate and (2) associated corrective action rate for (a) major and (b) minor non-conformances\n\n1 The entity shall disclose its supplier facilities' (1) non-conformance rate with external social and environmental audit standard(s) or internally developed supplier code(s) of conduct for (a) major non-conformances, and separately, (b) minor non-conformances.\n\n1.1 A major non-conformance is defined as the highest severity of non-conformance and require escalation by auditors. Major non-conformances confirm the presence of underage child workers (below the legal age for work or apprenticeship), forced labor, health and safety issues that can cause immediate danger to life or serious injury, and/or environmental practices that can cause serious and immediate harm to the community. Major non-conformance includes material breach or systemic breaking of code requirement or law. Major non-conformances may also be referred to as critical or priority non-conformances.\n\n1.2 A minor non-conformance is defined as a non-conformance that by itself is not indicative of a systemic problem with the management system. Minor non-conformances are typically isolated or random incidents and represent a low risk to workers and/or the environment.\n\n1.3 The entity shall calculate the non-conformance rates as the total number of non-conformances (in each respective category) identified among its supplier facilities divided by the number of supplier facilities audited.\n\n2 The entity shall disclose the (2) corrective action rates associated with its supplier facilities' (a) major non-conformances, and separately, (b) minor non-conformances.", "page_number": 210}
