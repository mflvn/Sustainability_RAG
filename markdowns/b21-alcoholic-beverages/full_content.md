# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Alcoholic Beverages industry rely on both purchased electricity and fuel as critical inputs for value creation. Fossil fuel and electrical energy consumption can contribute to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. These impacts have the potential to affect the value of companies in this industry as regulations of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and new incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy could lead to increased price volatility for fossil fuels and conventional electricity while making alternative sources cost-competitive. Companies that manage their overall energy use through increased efficiency and use of alternative energy sources can increase profitability by lowering expenses and reducing risk.

## Metrics

FB-AB-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable

1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.

2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

#### Page 205

3.3 The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity.

3.3.1 For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.2 For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

3.3.3 The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of renewable energy.

3.4 For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from biomass sources is limited to the following:

3.4.2 Energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state renewable portfolio standard.

4 The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data including electricity from solar or wind energy).

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Water management relates to a company's direct water usage, the exposure of its operations to water-scarce regions, and its management of wastewater. Companies in the Alcoholic Beverages industry use a large amount of water in their operations, as water is a key input to their finished products. Given alcoholic beverage companies' heavy reliance on large volumes of clean water and the fact that water stress is increasing in different regions globally, companies may be exposed to supply disruptions that could significantly impact operations and add to costs. Companies operating in water-stressed regions that fail to address local water concerns may face further risk of losing their social license to operate. Improving water management through increased efficiency and recycling, particularly in regions with baseline water stress, can lead to lower operating costs, reduced risk, and higher intangible asset value.

## Metrics

FB-AB-140a.1. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

1 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources.

1.1 Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities.

2 The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources.

2.1 Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.

2.2 Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.

3 The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.

3.1 Water consumption is defined as:

3.1.1 Water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge;

3.1.2 Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service;

3.1.3 Water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea.

#### Page 207

4 The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40–80 percent) or Extremely High (>80 percent) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.

5 The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn.

# Environmental & Social Impacts of Ingredient Supply Chain

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Alcoholic Beverages industry manage global supply chains to source a wide range of ingredient inputs. How companies screen, monitor, and engage with suppliers on environmental and social topics affects companies' ability to secure supply and manage price fluctuations. Supply chain interruption can cause loss of revenue and negatively impact market share if companies are not able to find alternatives for key suppliers or have to source ingredients at higher cost. Supply chain management issues related to labor practices, environmental responsibility, ethics or corruption may also result in regulatory fines and/or increased long-term operational costs. The consumer-facing nature of the industry increases the reputational risks associated with supplier actions. Managing a company's exposure to environmental and social risks can lead to improved supply chain resiliency and enhanced reputation. Companies can engage with key suppliers to manage environmental and social risks to improve supply chain resiliency, mitigate reputational risks, and potentially increase consumer demand or capture new market opportunities.

## Metrics

FB-AB-430a.1. Suppliers' social and environmental responsibility audit (1) non-conformance rate and (2) associated corrective action rate for (a) major and (b) minor non-conformances

1 The entity shall disclose its supplier facilities' (1) non-conformance rate with external social and environmental audit standard(s) or internally developed supplier code(s) of conduct for (a) major non-conformances, and separately, (b) minor non-conformances.

1.1 A major non-conformance is defined as the highest severity of non-conformance and require escalation by auditors. Major non-conformances confirm the presence of underage child workers (below the legal age for work or apprenticeship), forced labor, health and safety issues that can cause immediate danger to life or serious injury, and/or environmental practices that can cause serious and immediate harm to the community. Major non-conformance includes material breach or systemic breaking of code requirement or law. Major non-conformances may also be referred to as critical or priority non-conformances.

1.2 A minor non-conformance is defined as a non-conformance that by itself is not indicative of a systemic problem with the management system. Minor non-conformances are typically isolated or random incidents and represent a low risk to workers and/or the environment.

1.3 The entity shall calculate the non-conformance rates as the total number of non-conformances (in each respective category) identified among its supplier facilities divided by the number of supplier facilities audited.

2 The entity shall disclose the (2) corrective action rates associated with its supplier facilities' (a) major non-conformances, and separately, (b) minor non-conformances.

#### Page 211

2.1 A corrective action is defined as the completion of an action (generally identified in a corrective action plan) within 90 days for major non-conformances, and 60 days for minor non-conformances, that has been designed to eliminate the cause of a detected non-conformance. This includes, including the implementation of practices or systems to eliminate any non-conformance and ensure there will be no reoccurrence of the non-conformance, as well as verification that the action has taken place.

2.2 The entity shall calculate the corrective action rates as the number of corrective actions that address non-conformances (in each respective category) divided by the total number of non-conformances (in each respective category) that have been identified.

3 The entity shall disclose the standard(s) and/or code(s) of conduct to which it has measured social and environmental responsibility audit compliance.

3.1 For internally developed supplier code(s) of conduct, the entity shall disclose the public location where such code(s) can be viewed.

# Ingredient Sourcing

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Alcoholic Beverages industry source a wide range of ingredients, largely agricultural inputs, from suppliers worldwide. The industry's ability to source ingredients and at certain price points fluctuates with supply availability, which may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management, and other resource scarcity considerations. This exposure can lead to price volatility and can affect company profitability. Ultimately, climate change, water scarcity, and land-use restriction present risks to a company's long-term ability to source key materials and ingredients. Companies that source ingredients that are more productive, effectively cultivated, and less resource-intensive, or work closely with suppliers to increase their adaptability to climate change and manage exposure to other resource scarcity risks will be better protected from price volatility and/or supply disruptions.

## Metrics
