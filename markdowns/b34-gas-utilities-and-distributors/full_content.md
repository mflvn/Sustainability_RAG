# Industry Description

The Gas Utilities & Distributors industry is made up of gas distribution and marketing companies. Gas distribution involves operating local, low-pressure pipes to transfer natural gas from larger transmission pipes to end users. Gas marketing companies are gas brokers that aggregate natural gas into quantities that fit the needs of their different customers and then deliver it, generally through other companies' transmission and distribution lines. A relatively smaller portion of this industry is involved in propane gas distribution; therefore this standard is focused on natural gas distribution. Both types of gas are commonly used for heating and cooking by residential, commercial, and industrial customers. In structurally regulated markets, the utility is granted a full monopoly over the distribution and sale of natural gas. A regulator must approve the rates utilities charge to avoid the abuse of their monopoly position. In deregulated markets, distribution and marketing are legally separated and customers have a choice of which company to buy their gas from. In this case, a utility is guaranteed a monopoly only over distribution and is legally required to transmit all gas equitably along its pipes for a fixed fee. Overall, companies in the industry are tasked with providing safe, reliable, low-cost gas, while effectively managing their social and environmental impacts, such as community safety and methane emissions.

Note: The SASB Gas Utilities & Distributors industry does not include gas transmission companies that transport highly pressurized natural gas over long distances from the wellhead. Gas transmission companies are included in the Oil & Gas - Midstream industry (EM-MD) in the Extractives & Minerals Processing sector. Furthermore, the SASB standard for the Gas Utilities & Distributors industry covers activities related only to gas provision and not to electricity provision. Some utilities may operate in both gas and electricity markets. Companies undertaking activities related to electricity generation and/or distribution should also consider the separate SASB Standard for the Electric Utilities & Power Generators industry (IF-EU).

# End-Use Efficiency

## Topic Summary

Natural gas produces fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than other fossil fuels. Its expanded use in the economy is therefore a key strategy for many governments and regulators striving to reduce GHG emissions. Despite the relatively lower emissions, however, the natural gas value chain still produces meaningful levels of GHG emissions overall. As policymakers and regulators look to address climate change, efficient consumption of natural gas will be an important theme over the long term. There is a wide range of measures that utilities can take to promote energy efficiency among their customers, including offering rebates for energy-efficient appliances, weatherizing customers' homes, and educating customers on energy saving methods. How well a utility stands to gain or lose from the trend toward GHG mitigation is significantly predicated on its regulatory environment. Traditional rate structures generally do not give gas utilities an incentive for energy efficiency and, further, they may economically suffer from reductions in customer demand. This is increasingly driving gas utilities, and their regulators and customers, to pursue alternative ratemaking. Such alternative rate design often "decouples" utility revenues from customer consumption and may also build in explicit incentives for successful utility performance in terms of end-use efficiency and demand reductions. Overall, companies whose strategic plan includes efficiency initiatives that strive to reduce downside risks from demand fluctuations, gain returns on needed investments, and lower costs are more likely to be well positioned to earn stronger risk-adjusted returns over the long term.

## Metrics

### IF-GU-420a.2. Customer gas savings from efficiency measures by market

1 The entity shall disclose the total amount of gas savings delivered to customers, in million British thermal units (MMBtu), from energy efficiency measures during the reporting period for each of its markets.

1.1 Markets are defined as those operations that are subject to distinct public utility regulatory oversight.

1.2 Gas savings are defined according to the gross savings approach as the changes in energy consumption and/or demand that results from program-related actions taken by participants in an efficiency program, regardless of why they participated.

1.2.1 The entity may list those markets where it reports gas savings on a net savings basis and thus may be different from the figures disclosed here, where net gas savings are defined as changes in consumption that are specifically attributable to an energy efficiency program, and that would not otherwise have happened in the absence of the program.

2 Gas savings shall be calculated on a gross basis but consistent with the methodology set forth in national, state, or local evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) regulations where such savings occur.

#### Page 338

The scope of gas savings from efficiency measures includes savings delivered directly by the entity and, where regulations provide, savings substantiated by purchases of efficiency savings credits.

3.1 For any savings from efficiency measures delivered directly by the entity, any efficiency savings credits must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as delivered gas savings.

3.2 For efficiency savings credits that are purchased, the agreement must explicitly include and convey that credits be retained and retired on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them.

The entity shall consider guidance on regulations as a normative reference, thus any updates made year-on-year shall be considered updates to this guidance.

Note to IF-GU-420a.2

1 The entity shall discuss customer efficiency measures that are required by regulations for each of its relevant markets, including a discussion of:

1.1 The amount or percentage of gas savings from efficiency measures required by regulations for each market.

1.2 Instances of noncompliance with gas savings obligations.

1.2.1 In such instances, the entity shall disclose the difference between the gas savings delivered and the amount required by the regulation.

1.3 Gas savings delivered that exceed those required by regulations and that resulted in the entity receiving energy efficiency performance incentives, including the value of any such incentives.

#### Page 339

2 3    The entity shall discuss the policy mechanisms in place for each market that allows
for or incentivizes energy efficiency, including a discussion of the benefits,
challenges, and financial impacts associated with such mechanisms.

3.1 4.1 Deferral decoupling

3.2 4.2 Current period decoupling

3.3 4.3 Single fixed variable rates

3.4 4.4 Lost revenue adjustments

3.5 4.5 Energy efficiency feebates

4 5    The entity may discuss incentives it has developed for its customers that promote
end-use efficiency, including, but not limited to, energy efficiency rebates, and other
measures to subsidize customer energy efficiency.

# Integrity of Gas Delivery Infrastructure

## Topic Summary

Operating a vast network of gas pipelines, equipment, and storage facilities requires a multifaceted, long-term approach to ensuring the integrity of such infrastructure, and the management of related risks. While customers depend on constantly available gas supplies, companies are tasked with managing substantial risks—including those related to human health, property, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—that result from operating gas distribution networks and related infrastructure. Aging infrastructure, inadequate monitoring and maintenance, and other operational factors may lead to gas leaks. Gas leaks can result in safety-related risks, such as losses of containment, which may result in fires or explosions that can be particularly severe in urban areas where companies often operate. Furthermore, gas leaks also result in fugitive emissions (methane), causing adverse environmental impacts. Regulated gas utilities generally incur no direct costs for gas leaks, as the cost of gas is typically passed directly to customers (though this may vary by region). However, gas leaks that result in safety-related risks and/or fugitive emissions may financially impact companies through a variety of regulatory, legal, and product demand channels. Accidents, particularly fatal accidents, can result in claims of negligence against companies, leading to costly court battles and fines. GHG emissions may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny—a critical element directly connected to financial performance, given the importance of regulatory relations—and potential fines and penalties. Importantly, regulated gas utilities can also financially benefit from opportunities for capital investments designed to improve performance and mitigate risks related to safety and emissions. These capital investments may lead to higher rate bases, ultimately benefiting the company and its shareholders. Companies seek to manage such risks through pipeline replacements, regular inspections and monitoring, employee training and emergency preparedness, investments in technology, and other strategies—all typically done by working closely with regulators. In many parts of the country, concerns about aging infrastructure have caused companies in the industry to look for ways to expedite the replacement approval process, especially in cases where pipelines are located near densely populated areas.
