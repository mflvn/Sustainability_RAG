Percentage of distribution pipeline that is (1) cast and/or wrought iron and (2) unprotected steel\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the percentage, by length, in kilometers, of its natural gas pipelines that are (1) cast and/or wrought iron, and separately, (2) unprotected steel.\n\n1.1 A distribution pipeline is defined as a pipeline other than a gathering or transmission line, where:\n\n1.1.1 A gathering line is defined as a pipeline that transports gas from a current production facility to a transmission line or main; and\n\n1.1.2 A transmission line is defined as a pipeline, other than a gathering line, that (1) transports gas from a gathering line or storage facility to a distribution center, storage facility, or large-volume customer that is not downstream from a distribution center; (2) operates at a hoop stress of 20 percent or more of the specified minimum yield strength (SMYS); or (3) transports gas within a storage field.\n\n1.2 Cast and/or wrought iron is defined as iron that is heated to its melting point and poured into molds and cannot be molded or screwed.\n\n1.3 Unprotected steel is defined as steel with no form of corrosion protection.\n\n2 The percentage of (1) cast and/or wrought iron distribution pipelines shall be calculated as the total length of cast and/or wrought iron pipelines that the entity owns or operates divided by the total length of distribution pipelines that the entity owns and/or operates.\n\n3 The percentage of (2) unprotected steel distribution pipelines shall be calculated as the total length of unprotected steel pipelines that the entity owns or operates divided by the total length of distribution pipelines that the entity owns and/or operates.\n\n4 The entity may discuss its pipeline replacement rates, its use of polyethylene pipes, or other efforts to reduce fugitive emissions and leaks and improve the safety of its distribution pipelines.\n\n## IF-GU-540a.3. Percentage of gas (1) transmission and (2) distribution pipelines inspected\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the percentage, by length, of gas (1) transmission pipelines, and separately, (2) distribution pipelines that were inspected during the reporting period.\n\n1.1 A transmission pipeline is defined as a pipeline, other than a gathering line, that (1) transports gas from a gathering line or storage facility to a distribution center, storage facility, or large volume customer that is not down-stream from a distribution center; (2) operates at a hoop stress of 20 percent or more of the specified minimum yield strength (SMYS); or (3) transports gas within a storage field.\n"}
