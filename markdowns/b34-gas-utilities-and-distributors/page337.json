{"page_number": 337, "text_content": "# End-Use Efficiency\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nNatural gas produces fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than other fossil fuels. Its expanded use in the economy is therefore a key strategy for many governments and regulators striving to reduce GHG emissions. Despite the relatively lower emissions, however, the natural gas value chain still produces meaningful levels of GHG emissions overall. As policymakers and regulators look to address climate change, efficient consumption of natural gas will be an important theme over the long term. There is a wide range of measures that utilities can take to promote energy efficiency among their customers, including offering rebates for energy-efficient appliances, weatherizing customers' homes, and educating customers on energy saving methods. How well a utility stands to gain or lose from the trend toward GHG mitigation is significantly predicated on its regulatory environment. Traditional rate structures generally do not give gas utilities an incentive for energy efficiency and, further, they may economically suffer from reductions in customer demand. This is increasingly driving gas utilities, and their regulators and customers, to pursue alternative ratemaking. Such alternative rate design often \"decouples\" utility revenues from customer consumption and may also build in explicit incentives for successful utility performance in terms of end-use efficiency and demand reductions. Overall, companies whose strategic plan includes efficiency initiatives that strive to reduce downside risks from demand fluctuations, gain returns on needed investments, and lower costs are more likely to be well positioned to earn stronger risk-adjusted returns over the long term.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### IF-GU-420a.2. Customer gas savings from efficiency measures by market\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the total amount of gas savings delivered to customers, in million British thermal units (MMBtu), from energy efficiency measures during the reporting period for each of its markets.\n\n1.1 Markets are defined as those operations that are subject to distinct public utility regulatory oversight.\n\n1.2 Gas savings are defined according to the gross savings approach as the changes in energy consumption and/or demand that results from program-related actions taken by participants in an efficiency program, regardless of why they participated.\n\n1.2.1 The entity may list those markets where it reports gas savings on a net savings basis and thus may be different from the figures disclosed here, where net gas savings are defined as changes in consumption that are specifically attributable to an energy efficiency program, and that would not otherwise have happened in the absence of the program.\n\n2 Gas savings shall be calculated on a gross basis but consistent with the methodology set forth in national, state, or local evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) regulations where such savings occur."}
