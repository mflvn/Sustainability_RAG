{"text_content": "# Integrity of Gas Delivery Infrastructure\n\n## Topic Summary\n\nOperating a vast network of gas pipelines, equipment, and storage facilities requires a multifaceted, long-term approach to ensuring the integrity of such infrastructure, and the management of related risks. While customers depend on constantly available gas supplies, companies are tasked with managing substantial risks\u2014including those related to human health, property, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\u2014that result from operating gas distribution networks and related infrastructure. Aging infrastructure, inadequate monitoring and maintenance, and other operational factors may lead to gas leaks. Gas leaks can result in safety-related risks, such as losses of containment, which may result in fires or explosions that can be particularly severe in urban areas where companies often operate. Furthermore, gas leaks also result in fugitive emissions (methane), causing adverse environmental impacts. Regulated gas utilities generally incur no direct costs for gas leaks, as the cost of gas is typically passed directly to customers (though this may vary by region). However, gas leaks that result in safety-related risks and/or fugitive emissions may financially impact companies through a variety of regulatory, legal, and product demand channels. Accidents, particularly fatal accidents, can result in claims of negligence against companies, leading to costly court battles and fines. GHG emissions may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny\u2014a critical element directly connected to financial performance, given the importance of regulatory relations\u2014and potential fines and penalties. Importantly, regulated gas utilities can also financially benefit from opportunities for capital investments designed to improve performance and mitigate risks related to safety and emissions. These capital investments may lead to higher rate bases, ultimately benefiting the company and its shareholders. Companies seek to manage such risks through pipeline replacements, regular inspections and monitoring, employee training and emergency preparedness, investments in technology, and other strategies\u2014all typically done by working closely with regulators. In many parts of the country, concerns about aging infrastructure have caused companies in the industry to look for ways to expedite the replacement approval process, especially in cases where pipelines are located near densely populated areas.\n\n## Metrics\n\nIF-GU-540a.1. Number of (1) reportable pipeline incidents, (2) corrective actions received, and (3) violations of pipeline safety statutes\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the number of reportable pipeline incidents, where:\n\n    1.1 Reportable incidents are defined as events that involve a release of gas from a pipeline and that result in one or more of the following consequences: a death or personal injury necessitating in-patient hospitalization; estimated property damage of equivalent to $50,000 USD or more, including losses to the operator, losses to others, or both, but excluding the cost of gas lost; an unintentional estimated gas loss of three million cubic feet or more; or an event that is significant in the judgment of the operator.\n", "page_number": 340}
