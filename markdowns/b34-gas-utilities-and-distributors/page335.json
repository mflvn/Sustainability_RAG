{"page_number": 335, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Gas Utilities & Distributors industry is made up of gas distribution and marketing companies. Gas distribution involves operating local, low-pressure pipes to transfer natural gas from larger transmission pipes to end users. Gas marketing companies are gas brokers that aggregate natural gas into quantities that fit the needs of their different customers and then deliver it, generally through other companies' transmission and distribution lines. A relatively smaller portion of this industry is involved in propane gas distribution; therefore this standard is focused on natural gas distribution. Both types of gas are commonly used for heating and cooking by residential, commercial, and industrial customers. In structurally regulated markets, the utility is granted a full monopoly over the distribution and sale of natural gas. A regulator must approve the rates utilities charge to avoid the abuse of their monopoly position. In deregulated markets, distribution and marketing are legally separated and customers have a choice of which company to buy their gas from. In this case, a utility is guaranteed a monopoly only over distribution and is legally required to transmit all gas equitably along its pipes for a fixed fee. Overall, companies in the industry are tasked with providing safe, reliable, low-cost gas, while effectively managing their social and environmental impacts, such as community safety and methane emissions.\n\nNote: The SASB Gas Utilities & Distributors industry does not include gas transmission companies that transport highly pressurized natural gas over long distances from the wellhead. Gas transmission companies are included in the Oil & Gas - Midstream industry (EM-MD) in the Extractives & Minerals Processing sector. Furthermore, the SASB standard for the Gas Utilities & Distributors industry covers activities related only to gas provision and not to electricity provision. Some utilities may operate in both gas and electricity markets. Companies undertaking activities related to electricity generation and/or distribution should also consider the separate SASB Standard for the Electric Utilities & Power Generators industry (IF-EU).\n\n[^42]: Note to IF-GU-420a.2 \u2013 The entity shall discuss customer efficiency measures that are required by regulations for each of its relevant markets."}
