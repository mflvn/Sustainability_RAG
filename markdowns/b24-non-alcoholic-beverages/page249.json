Companies in the Non-Alcoholic Beverages industry use a large amount of water in their operations, as water is a key input to finished products. Given non-alcoholic beverage companies' heavy reliance on large volumes of clean water and the fact that water stress is increasing in different regions globally, companies may be exposed to supply disruptions that could significantly impact operations and add to costs. Companies operating in water-stressed regions that fail to address local water concerns may face further risk of losing their social license to operate. Additionally, proper wastewater treatment is an important element of managing water issues in operations, because bottling plants release large quantities of effluents. Improving water management through increased efficiency, recycling, and proper disposal, particularly in regions with baseline water stress, can lead to lower operating costs, reduced risks, and higher intangible asset value.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFB-NB-140a.1. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1    The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources.\n\n1.1    Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities.\n\n2    The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources.\n\n2.1    Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n2.2    Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n3    The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.\n\n3.1    Water consumption is defined as:\n\n3.1.1    Water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge;\n\n3.1.2    Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service;"}
