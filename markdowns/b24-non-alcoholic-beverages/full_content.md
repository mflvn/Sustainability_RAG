# Fleet Fuel Management

## Topic Summary

Non-alcoholic beverages companies generate direct Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from large vehicle fleets for distribution and from manufacturing facilities. Specifically, refrigeration used in manufacturing facilities and in transport vehicles contributes to a large portion of overall emissions for the industry. Efficiencies gained in fuel use can reduce costs, mitigate exposure to fossil fuel price volatility, and limit emissions from production, storage, and transportation of products. Short-term capital expenditures in fuel efficient fleets and more energy-efficient technologies may be outweighed by long-term operational savings and mitigation of regulatory risk.

## Metrics

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Non-Alcoholic Beverages industry use significant energy to operate manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and warehouses. Companies in the industry generally purchase electricity from the grid. Energy generation contributes to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution, which have the potential to indirectly, yet materially, impact the operations of non-alcoholic beverages companies. Companies can reduce energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their operations by implementing more efficient technologies and processes. Decisions regarding the use of alternative fuels, renewable energy, and on-site generation of electricity versus purchasing from the grid, can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of the energy supply.

## Metrics

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Water management relates to a company's direct water usage, the exposure of its operations to water-stressed regions, and its management of wastewater. Companies in the Non-Alcoholic Beverages industry use a large amount of water in their operations, as water is a key input to finished products. Given non-alcoholic beverage companies' heavy reliance on large volumes of clean water and the fact that water stress is increasing in different regions globally, companies may be exposed to supply disruptions that could significantly impact operations and add to costs. Companies operating in water-stressed regions that fail to address local water concerns may face further risk of losing their social license to operate. Additionally, proper wastewater treatment is an important element of managing water issues in operations, because bottling plants release large quantities of effluents. Improving water management through increased efficiency, recycling, and proper disposal, particularly in regions with baseline water stress, can lead to lower operating costs, reduced risks, and higher intangible asset value.

## Metrics

# Environmental & Social Impacts of Ingredient Supply Chain

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Non-Alcoholic Beverages industry manage global supply chains to source a wide range of ingredient inputs. How companies screen, monitor, and engage with suppliers on environmental and social topics affects the ability of companies to secure supply and manage price fluctuations. Supply chain interruption can cause loss of revenue and negatively impact market share if companies are not able to find alternatives for key suppliers or have to source ingredients at higher cost. Supply chain management issues related to labor practices, environmental responsibility, ethics, or corruption may also result in regulatory fines and/or increased long-term operational costs for companies. The consumer-facing nature of the industry increases the reputational risks associated with supplier actions Managing a company's exposure to environmental and social risks can lead to improved supply chain resiliency and enhanced reputation, which provide value to shareholders. Companies can engage with key suppliers to manage environmental and social risks to improve supply chain resiliency, mitigate reputational risks, and potentially increase consumer demand or capture new market opportunities.

## Metrics

FB-NB-430a.1. Suppliers' social and environmental responsibility audit (1) non-conformance rate and (2) associated corrective action rate for (a) major and (b) minor non-conformances

1. The entity shall disclose its supplier facilities' (1) non-conformance rate with external social and environmental audit standard(s) or internally developed supplier code(s) of conduct for (a) major non-conformances, and separately, (b) minor non-conformances.

   1.1 A major non-conformance is defined as the highest severity of non-conformance and require escalation by auditors. Major non-conformances confirm the presence of underage child workers (below the legal age for work or apprenticeship), forced labor, health and safety issues that can cause immediate danger to life or serious injury, and/or environmental practices that can cause serious and immediate harm to the community. Major non-conformance includes material breach or systemic breaking of code requirement or law. Major non-conformances may also be referred to as critical or priority non-conformances.

   1.2 A minor non-conformance is defined as a non-conformance that by itself is not indicative of a systemic problem with the management system. Minor non-conformances are typically isolated or random incidents and represent a low risk to workers and/or the environment.

   1.3 The entity shall calculate the non-conformance rates as the total number of non-conformances (in each respective category) identified among its supplier facilities divided by the number of supplier facilities audited.

2. The entity shall disclose the (2) corrective action rates associated with its supplier facilities' (a) major non-conformances, and separately, (b) minor non-conformances.

#### Page 254

2.1    A corrective action is defined as the completion of an action (generally identified in a corrective action plan) within 90 days for major non-conformances, and 60 days for minor non-conformances, that has been designed to eliminate the cause of a detected non-conformance, including the implementation of practices or systems to eliminate any non-conformance and ensure there will be no reoccurrence of the non-conformance, as well as verification that the action has taken place.

2.2    The entity shall calculate the corrective action rates as the number of corrective actions that address non-conformances (in each respective category) divided by the total number of non-conformances (in each respective category) that have been identified.

3    The entity shall disclose the standards and/or code(s) of conduct to which it has measured social and environmental responsibility audit compliance.

3.1    For internally developed supplier code(s) of conduct, the entity shall disclose the public location where such code(s) can be viewed.

# Ingredient Sourcing

## Topic Summary

Companies in the Non-Alcoholic Beverages industry source a wide range of ingredients from suppliers worldwide. The industry's ability to source ingredients and at certain price points fluctuates with supply availability, which may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management, and other resource scarcity considerations. This exposure can lead to price volatility which may affect company profitability. Ultimately, climate change, water scarcity, and land-use restrictions present risks to a company's long-term ability to source key materials and ingredients. Companies that source ingredients which are more productive and less resource-intensive, or work closely with suppliers to increase their adaptability to climate change and other resource scarcity risks will be better protected from price volatility and/or supply disruptions.
