The industry's ability to source ingredients and at certain price points fluctuates with supply availability, which may be affected by climate change, water scarcity, land management, and other resource scarcity considerations. This exposure can lead to price volatility which may affect company profitability. Ultimately, climate change, water scarcity, and land-use restrictions present risks to a company's long-term ability to source key materials and ingredients. Companies that source ingredients which are more productive and less resource-intensive, or work closely with suppliers to increase their adaptability to climate change and other resource scarcity risks will be better protected from price volatility and/or supply disruptions.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFB-NB-440a.1. Percentage of beverage ingredients sourced from regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1 The entity shall disclose the percentage of beverage ingredients sourced from regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress.\n\n2 The percentage shall be calculated as the cost of beverage ingredients purchased from Tier 1 suppliers that withdraw and consume water in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress for the production of the beverage ingredients divided by the total cost of agricultural products purchased from Tier 1 suppliers.\n\n2.1 Tier 1 suppliers are defined as suppliers that transact directly with the entity for agricultural products.\n\n2.2 The entity shall identify Tier 1 suppliers that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40-80%) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.\n\n3 If the entity is unable to identify or collect data pertaining to all Tier 1 suppliers, the entity shall disclose the percentage of agricultural products for which the source region and water risks are unknown.\n\nFB-NB-440a.2. List of priority beverage ingredients and description of sourcing risks due to environmental and social considerations\n\n1 The entity shall identify the highest priority beverage ingredients to its business.\n\n1.1 Priority beverage ingredients are defined as ingredients (excluding water) that constitute the largest beverage ingredient expense and/or those ingredients that have otherwise been identified by the entity as essential to its products or as having significant environmental or social risks.\n\n1.2 The scope of disclosure includes priority beverage ingredients sourced by the entity, including, but not limited to, those sourced directly from contract growers and from producer supply agreements."}
