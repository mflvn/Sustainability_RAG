Specifically, refrigeration used in manufacturing facilities and in transport vehicles contributes to a large portion of overall emissions for the industry. Efficiencies gained in fuel use can reduce costs, mitigate exposure to fossil fuel price volatility, and limit emissions from production, storage, and transportation of products. Short-term capital expenditures in fuel efficient fleets and more energy-efficient technologies may be outweighed by long-term operational savings and mitigation of regulatory risk.\n\n## Metrics\n\n### FB-NB-110a.1. Fleet fuel consumed, percentage renewable\n\n1. The entity shall disclose the total amount of fuel consumed by its fleet vehicles as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).\n\n   1.1 The calculation methodology for fuel consumed shall be based on actual fuel consumed as opposed to design parameters.\n\n   1.2 Acceptable calculation methodologies for fuel consumed include, but are not limited to, methodologies based on:\n      1.2.1 Adding fuel purchases made during the reporting period to beginning inventory at the start of the reporting period, less any fuel inventory at the end of the reporting period\n      1.2.2 Tracking fuel consumed by vehicles\n      1.2.3 Tracking fuel expenses\n\n2. The entity shall disclose the percentage of the total amount of fuel consumed by its fleet vehicles that is renewable fuel.\n\n   2.1 Renewable fuel is generally defined as fuel that meets all of the following requirements:\n      2.1.1 Produced from renewable biomass;\n      2.1.2 Used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel present in a transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel; and\n      2.1.3 Achieved net Has lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction on a life cycle basis that are at least 20 percent less than baseline lifecycle GHG emissions, unless the fuel is exempt from this requirement pursuant to U.S. 40 CFR 80.1403.\n\n   2.2 The entity shall disclose the standard or regulation used to determine if a fuel is renewable.\n"}
