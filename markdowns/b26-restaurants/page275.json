Supply chain management is crucial for restaurants to ensure food safety, protect their reputations, and improve revenues. Sourcing quality ingredients to maintain a consistent level of quality across different locations can be operationally challenging. This problem is exacerbated by the global nature of the industry. Demand from food and beverage industries, including restaurants, drives and shapes agricultural production, indicating that actions by industry players have larger impacts on society. Therefore, sustainable and ethical sourcing by industry players is necessary to ensure continued future supply and to minimize lifecycle impacts of company operations. Sourcing from suppliers that have high quality standards, employ environmentally sustainable farming methods, and honor labor rights will better position companies to protect long-term shareholder value. By increasing the amount of food supply sourced in conformance with environmental and social standards, as well as conformance with animal welfare standards and best practices, restaurant operators will be able to maintain food quality, manage food safety issues, enhance their reputation, and expand their market share.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFB-RN-430a.1.
