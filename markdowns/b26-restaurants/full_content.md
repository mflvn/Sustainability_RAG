# Industry Description

Companies in the Restaurants industry prepare meals, snacks, and beverages to customers' orders for immediate on- and off-premises consumption. Broadly divided into three sub-categories, the restaurant industry includes limited-service eating places, casual full-service eating places, and upscale full-service eating places. Limited-service restaurants provide services to customers who order and pay before eating. Fast-food restaurants represent the largest share of the limited-service restaurants segment. Full-service restaurants offer more service, food for consumption primarily on-premise, and typically reflect higher quality food and prices.

# Energy Management

## Topic Summary

Restaurant operations have high energy intensity compared to other commercial building operations. Commercial kitchen appliances are extremely energy intensive, and dining areas are typically temperature-controlled for customers. Fossil fuel-based energy production and consumption contribute to significant environmental impacts, including climate change and air pollution, which have the potential to indirectly, yet materially, impact the results of restaurant operations. Regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing or regulatory incentives for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy affect conventional and renewable energy prices. Companies that manage energy consumption at company-owned and franchise locations can decrease operational costs through energy efficiency upgrades and limit exposure to GHG emissions regulations through the use of renewable energy resources.

## Metrics

FB-RN-130a.1. (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable

1 The entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ).

1.1 The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption.

1.2 The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period.

1.3 In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

2 The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity.

2.1 The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.

3 The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy.

3.1 Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass.

3.2 The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.

#### Page 272

3.3    The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity
       consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable
       energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power
       purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy
       certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy
       Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that
       explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs
       are paired with grid electricity.

       3.3.1  For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs
              must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf
              of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable
              energy.

       3.3.2  For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement
              must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained
              or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order
              for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.

       3.3.3  The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of
              the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of
              renewable energy.

3.4    For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from
       biomass sources is limited to the following:

       3.4.2  Energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a
              third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable
              Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest
              Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered
              eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for
              Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional
              standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state
              renewable portfolio standard.

4      The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under
       this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and
       conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data including electricity
       from solar or wind energy).

# Water Management

## Topic Summary

Water is used throughout restaurant operations, from cooking and dishwashing to cleaning. The restaurant format, size, and equipment all affect water use. Restaurants located in water-stressed regions may be exposed to water usage restrictions or face high water costs. Long-term historic increases in the costs of water, and expectations around continued increases due to overconsumption and constrained supplies resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution, and climate change, indicate the heightened importance of water management. Companies can reduce water use and associated operational costs through implementing water-efficient practices and using water-efficient commercial kitchen equipment.

## Metrics

FB-RN-140a.1. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress

1    The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources.

1.1    Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities.

2    The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources.

2.1    Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.

2.2    Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.

3    The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.

3.1    Water consumption is defined as:

3.1.1    Water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge;

3.1.2    Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service;

3.1.3    Water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea.

# Supply Chain Management & Food Sourcing

## Topic Summary

Restaurants source ingredients and products from a wide range of suppliers. Supply chain management is crucial for restaurants to ensure food safety, protect their reputations, and improve revenues. Sourcing quality ingredients to maintain a consistent level of quality across different locations can be operationally challenging. This problem is exacerbated by the global nature of the industry. Demand from food and beverage industries, including restaurants, drives and shapes agricultural production, indicating that actions by industry players have larger impacts on society. Therefore, sustainable and ethical sourcing by industry players is necessary to ensure continued future supply and to minimize lifecycle impacts of company operations. Sourcing from suppliers that have high quality standards, employ environmentally sustainable farming methods, and honor labor rights will better position companies to protect long-term shareholder value. By increasing the amount of food supply sourced in conformance with environmental and social standards, as well as conformance with animal welfare standards and best practices, restaurant operators will be able to maintain food quality, manage food safety issues, enhance their reputation, and expand their market share.
