{"page_number": 270, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nCompanies in the Restaurants industry prepare meals, snacks, and beverages to customers' orders for immediate on- and off-premises consumption. Broadly divided into three sub-categories, the restaurant industry includes limited-service eating places, casual full-service eating places, and upscale full-service eating places. Limited-service restaurants provide services to customers who order and pay before eating. Fast-food restaurants represent the largest share of the limited-service restaurants segment. Full-service restaurants offer more service, food for consumption primarily on-premise, and typically reflect higher quality food and prices."}
