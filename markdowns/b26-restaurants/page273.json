The restaurant format, size, and equipment all affect water use. Restaurants located in water-stressed regions may be exposed to water usage restrictions or face high water costs. Long-term historic increases in the costs of water, and expectations around continued increases due to overconsumption and constrained supplies resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution, and climate change, indicate the heightened importance of water management. Companies can reduce water use and associated operational costs through implementing water-efficient practices and using water-efficient commercial kitchen equipment.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFB-RN-140a.1. (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress\n\n1    The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources.\n\n1.1    Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities.\n\n2    The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources.\n\n2.1    Fresh water may be defined according to the local laws and regulations where the entity operates. Where there is no legal definition, fresh water shall be considered to be water that has less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved solids.\n\n2.2    Water obtained from a water utility in compliance with jurisdictional drinking water regulations can be assumed to meet the definition of fresh water.\n\n3    The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations.\n\n3.1    Water consumption is defined as:\n\n3.1.1    Water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge;\n\n3.1.2    Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service;\n\n3.1.3    Water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea.\n", "page_number": 273}
