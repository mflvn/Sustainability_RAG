{"page_number": 174, "text_content": "# Industry Description\n\nThe Investment Banking & Brokerage industry consists of firms performing a wide range of functions in the capital markets, including assisting with the capital-raising and allocation process, and providing market-making and advisory services for corporations, financial institutions, governments, and high net-worth individuals. Specific activities include financial advisory and securities underwriting services conducted on a fee basis; securities and commodities brokerage activities, which involves buying and selling securities or commodities contracts and options on a commission or fee basis for investors; and trading and principal investment activities, which involves the buying and selling of equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities, and other securities for client-driven and proprietary trading. Investment banks also originate and securitize loans for infrastructure and other projects. Companies in the industry generate their revenues from global markets and, therefore, are exposed to various regulatory environments. The industry continues to face regulatory pressure to reform and disclose aspects of operations that present systemic risks. Specifically, firms are facing new capital requirements, stress testing, limits on proprietary trading, and increased scrutiny on compensation practices.\n\nNote: The SASB Investment Banking & Brokerage (FN-IB) Standard addresses \"pure play\" investment banking and brokerage services, which the SASB recognizes may not include all the activities of integrated financial institutions, such as mortgage finance, commercial banking, consumer finance, asset management and custody services, and insurance. Separate SASB accounting standards are available that address the sustainability issues for activities in those industries."}
