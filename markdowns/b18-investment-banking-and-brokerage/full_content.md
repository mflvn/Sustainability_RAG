# Industry Description

The Investment Banking & Brokerage industry consists of firms performing a wide range of functions in the capital markets, including assisting with the capital-raising and allocation process, and providing market-making and advisory services for corporations, financial institutions, governments, and high net-worth individuals. Specific activities include financial advisory and securities underwriting services conducted on a fee basis; securities and commodities brokerage activities, which involves buying and selling securities or commodities contracts and options on a commission or fee basis for investors; and trading and principal investment activities, which involves the buying and selling of equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities, and other securities for client-driven and proprietary trading. Investment banks also originate and securitize loans for infrastructure and other projects. Companies in the industry generate their revenues from global markets and, therefore, are exposed to various regulatory environments. The industry continues to face regulatory pressure to reform and disclose aspects of operations that present systemic risks. Specifically, firms are facing new capital requirements, stress testing, limits on proprietary trading, and increased scrutiny on compensation practices.

Note: The SASB Investment Banking & Brokerage (FN-IB) Standard addresses "pure play" investment banking and brokerage services, which the SASB recognizes may not include all the activities of integrated financial institutions, such as mortgage finance, commercial banking, consumer finance, asset management and custody services, and insurance. Separate SASB accounting standards are available that address the sustainability issues for activities in those industries.

25 Note to FN-IB-000.B – The entity shall use the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) for classifying investees and borrowers.

# Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Investment Banking & Brokerage Activities

## Topic Summary

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors can have material implications for the companies, assets, and projects that investment banks provide services to or invest in across a range of industries. Therefore, by taking these factors into account in their underwriting, advisory, and investing and lending activities, investment banks can address significant positive and negative environmental and social externalities. The potential for both value creation and loss associated with ESG factors suggests that investment banking and brokerage firms have a responsibility to their shareholders and clients to incorporate consideration of these factors into analysis and valuation related to all core products, including sell-side research, advisory services, origination, underwriting, and principal transactions. Investment banking and brokerage companies that fail to address these risks and opportunities could expose themselves to increased reputational and financial risks. On the other hand, appropriately pricing ESG risks could reduce investment banks' financial risk exposure, help generate additional revenue, and/or open new market opportunities. To help investors understand how well companies in the industry manage performance around this issue, investment banks should disclose how ESG factors are incorporated into their core products and services.

# Transition Risk Exposure

## Topic Summary

Risks and opportunities relating to the transition to a lower-carbon economy can have significant implications for the entities, assets, and projects that investment banks service either through the provision of finance and/or other capital markets activities and financial advisory services. With respect to the latter, policy change, technological innovation and shifting market dynamics, can give rise to transition risks including reputational damage which could ultimately impact the bank's enterprise value. Alternatively, the transition to a lower-carbon economy could open new market opportunities leading to increased revenue. Measuring and disclosing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the provision of core products and services such as underwriting, advisory and securitisation activities—a concept known as 'facilitated emissions'—can provide useful information to enable users of general purpose financial reporting to assess implications for the revenue generated by the entity's capital markets activities.

## Metrics

   1.4 Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions are defined and shall be calculated according to the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), Revised Edition, March 2004, published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD).

FN-IB-2. Description of the methodology used to calculate facilitated emissions

1 The entity shall describe the methodology used to calculate facilitated emissions.

1.1 Facilitated emissions refers to the gross emissions of a counterparty that is attributed to the entity providing capital markets and financial advisory services to the counterparty, which falls under Scope 3: category 15 (investments) in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard.
