Therefore, by taking these factors into account in their underwriting, advisory, and investing and lending activities, investment banks can address significant positive and negative environmental and social externalities. The potential for both value creation and loss associated with ESG factors suggests that investment banking and brokerage firms have a responsibility to their shareholders and clients to incorporate consideration of these factors into analysis and valuation related to all core products, including sell-side research, advisory services, origination, underwriting, and principal transactions. Investment banking and brokerage companies that fail to address these risks and opportunities could expose themselves to increased reputational and financial risks. On the other hand, appropriately pricing ESG risks could reduce investment banks' financial risk exposure, help generate additional revenue, and/or open new market opportunities. To help investors understand how well companies in the industry manage performance around this issue, investment banks should disclose how ESG factors are incorporated into their core products and services.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFN-IB-410a.1.
