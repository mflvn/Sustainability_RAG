With respect to the latter, policy change, technological innovation and shifting market dynamics, can give rise to transition risks including reputational damage which could ultimately impact the bank's enterprise value. Alternatively, the transition to a lower-carbon economy could open new market opportunities leading to increased revenue. Measuring and disclosing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the provision of core products and services such as underwriting, advisory and securitisation activities\u2014a concept known as 'facilitated emissions'\u2014can provide useful information to enable users of general purpose financial reporting to assess implications for the revenue generated by the entity's capital markets activities.\n\n## Metrics\n\nFN-IB-1.
