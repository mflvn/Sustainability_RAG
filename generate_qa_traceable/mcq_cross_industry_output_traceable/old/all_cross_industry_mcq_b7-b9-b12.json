    "optionA": "EM-CO-110a.1 and EM-IS-110a.1, which are both about gross global Scope 1 emissions and percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations.",
    "optionB": "There are no common metrics shared between the two industries.",
    "optionC": "EM-CO-110a.2 and EM-IS-110a.2, which are both about discussion of strategy/plan to manage Scope 1 emissions and emission reduction targets.",
    "optionD": "EM-CO-140a.1 and EM-IS-140a.1, which are both about total fresh water withdrawn, percentage recycled, and percentage in regions with high water stress.",
    "optionE": "EM-CO-420a.1 and EM-IS-430a.1, which are about sensitivity of reserves to price scenarios and managing supply chain risks respectively.",
