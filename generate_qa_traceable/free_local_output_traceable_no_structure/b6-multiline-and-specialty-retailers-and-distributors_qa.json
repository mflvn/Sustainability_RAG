    "question": "What does a company need to disclose regarding the percentage of energy consumed that is renewable energy?",
    "answer": "The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy. Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass. The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.",

    "question": "What are some key characteristics of the multiline and specialty retailers & distributors industry according to the industry description?",
    "answer": "Common to these companies (except for the distribution segment) is that they manage global supply chains to anticipate consumer demands, keep costs low, and keep products stocked in their brick-and-mortar storefronts. This is a highly competitive industry, in which each company category generally has a small number of key players, characterized by generally low margins. The relatively substitutable nature of retail makes companies in this industry especially susceptible to reputational risks.",
