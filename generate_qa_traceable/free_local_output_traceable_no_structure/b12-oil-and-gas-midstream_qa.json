    "question": "What are the specific requirements for a company to disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions according to the IFRS standards?",
    "answer": "1 The entity shall disclose its gross global Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol\u2014carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083). 1.1 Emissions of all GHGs shall be consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO\u2082-e), calculated in accordance with published 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values. To date, the preferred source for GWP factors is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014). 1.2 Gross emissions are GHGs emitted into the atmosphere before accounting for offsets, credits, or other similar mechanisms that have reduced or compensated for emissions.",

    "answer": "3 The entity shall disclose the percentage of gross global Scope 1 emissions from methane emissions. 3.1 The percentage of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions from methane emissions shall be calculated as the methane emissions in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO\u2082-e) divided by the gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO\u2082-e).",
