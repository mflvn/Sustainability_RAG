    "answer": "The midstream industry generates significant quantities of greenhouse gases and other air emissions from compressor engine exhausts, oil and condensate tank vents, natural gas processing, and fugitive emissions, in addition to emissions from mobile sources. GHG emissions contribute to climate change and create additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for midstream companies due to climate change mitigation policies. At the same time, the management of fugitive emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, has emerged as a major operational, reputational, and regulatory risk. Financial impacts on companies will vary depending on the specific location of operations and the prevailing emissions regulations, and include higher operating or capital expenditures and regulatory or legal penalties. Companies that capture and monetize, or cost-effectively reduce emissions by implementing innovative monitoring and mitigation efforts and fuel efficiency measures could enjoy several benefits. These companies have the opportunity to reduce regulatory risks and to realize operational efficiencies in an environment of increasing regulatory and public concerns about air quality and climate change.",

Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass. The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption. The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity.",

    "answer": "The IFRS S2 standard states that commercial banks accept deposits and make loans to individuals and corporations as well as engage in lending for infrastructure, real estate, and other projects. By providing these services, the industry serves an essential role in the functioning of global economies and in facilitating the transfer of financial resources to their most productive capacity. The industry is driven by the volume of deposits, quality of loans made, the economic environment, and interest rates. It is further characterized by risk from mismatched assets and liabilities.",
