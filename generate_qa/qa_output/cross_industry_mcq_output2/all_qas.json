The Chemicals industry is required to report on revenue from products designed for use-phase resource efficiency (RT-CH-410a.1), which encompasses a broad range of efficiency improvements. In contrast, the Aerospace & Defense industry specifically focuses on fuel economy and emissions in the use-phase, with metrics like revenue from alternative energy-related products (RT-AE-410a.1) and strategies to address fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions of products (RT-AE-410a.2).

    "optionE": "Processed Foods excludes water, while Apparel includes all inputs",
    "answer": "A: Apparel uses weight, while Processed Foods uses cost",
    "explanation": "The key difference is in the calculation method. For the Apparel industry, the metric CG-AA-440a.2 calculates the percentage based on the weight of raw materials. In contrast, the Processed Foods industry metric FB-PF-430a.1 uses the cost of food ingredients purchased from Tier 1 suppliers. This difference reflects the distinct nature of inputs in each industry and affects how companies must track and report their sustainably sourced materials.",

    "explanation": "Both the Appliance Manufacturing industry (CG-AM-410a.1 and CG-AM-410a.2) and the Chemicals industry (RT-CH-410a.1) include metrics related to revenue from products designed for use-phase efficiency or resource efficiency. This metric allows companies in both industries to quantify their progress in developing more sustainable products.",
