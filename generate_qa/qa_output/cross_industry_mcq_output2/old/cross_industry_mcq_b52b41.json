    "optionA": "Total energy consumed",
    "optionB": "Percentage of grid electricity used",
    "optionC": "Total water withdrawn",
    "optionD": "Number of facilities in 100-year flood zones",
    "optionE": "Area of land with protected conservation status",
    "answer": "D: Number of facilities in 100-year flood zones",
    "explanation": "The Hotels & Lodging industry is required to disclose the number of lodging facilities located in 100-year flood zones (SV-HL-450a.1), which is not a requirement for the Forestry Management industry. This metric is specific to the climate change adaptation considerations for hotels. In contrast, the Forestry Management industry has different climate-related disclosures, such as describing strategies to manage climate change risks and opportunities (RR-FM-450a.1).",

For Hotels & Lodging, the focus is on physical risks to properties, such as damage from flooding and inclement weather, which could impact asset values and revenues (SV-HL-450a.1). In contrast, the Forestry Management industry focuses on how climate change could affect forest productivity, including changes in growth rates, pest migrations, and fire frequency, which could impact timber yield and overall forest health (RR-FM-450a.1).",
