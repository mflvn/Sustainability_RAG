Reporting Requirements,"According to IFRS S2, which of the following is a required disclosure for both Iron & Steel Producers and Oil & Gas - Midstream companies regarding their Scope 1 emissions?",The percentage of emissions covered under emissions-limiting regulations,The percentage of emissions from methane,The total amount of energy consumed,The percentage of renewable energy used,The carbon intensity of production,A. The percentage of emissions covered under emissions-limiting regulations,"Both Iron & Steel Producers (EM-IS-110a.1) and Oil & Gas - Midstream (EM-MD-110a.1) companies are required to disclose the percentage of their Scope 1 emissions that are covered under emissions-limiting regulations. This is a common requirement across these industries, reflecting the regulatory focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in these sectors.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Iron & Steel Producers', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Midstream']","['71', '109-111']","These extractive industries have substantial environmental impacts, including emissions, land use, and water consumption, making them critical to compare in sustainability reporting.","['b7-coal-operations', 'b9-iron-and-steel-producers', 'b12-oil-and-gas-midstream']"
Reporting Requirements,"When discussing long-term and short-term strategies to manage Scope 1 emissions, which of the following is specifically mentioned as a category of emissions for Oil & Gas - Midstream companies but not for Iron & Steel Producers?",Flared hydrocarbons,Process emissions,Combusted emissions,Fugitive emissions,Vented emissions,A. Flared hydrocarbons,"In the discussion of long-term and short-term strategies to manage Scope 1 emissions, flared hydrocarbons are specifically mentioned as a category of emissions for Oil & Gas - Midstream companies (EM-MD-110a.2). This category is not explicitly mentioned for Iron & Steel Producers, reflecting the different nature of emissions sources in these industries.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Iron & Steel Producers', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Midstream']","['71-74', '111-113']","These extractive industries have substantial environmental impacts, including emissions, land use, and water consumption, making them critical to compare in sustainability reporting.","['b7-coal-operations', 'b9-iron-and-steel-producers', 'b12-oil-and-gas-midstream']"
Metric Selection and Calculation,"When calculating the percentage of Scope 1 emissions covered under emissions-limiting regulations for both Iron & Steel Producers and Oil & Gas - Midstream companies, which of the following should be excluded?",California Cap-and-Trade emissions,European Union Emissions Trading Scheme emissions,Quebec Cap-and-Trade emissions,Emissions covered under voluntary trading systems,Emissions subject to carbon tax systems,D. Emissions covered under voluntary trading systems,"For both Iron & Steel Producers and Oil & Gas - Midstream companies, when calculating the percentage of Scope 1 emissions covered under emissions-limiting regulations, emissions covered under voluntary emissions-limiting regulations (e.g., voluntary trading systems) should be excluded. This ensures that only mandatory, regulatory-driven emissions limitations are considered in the calculation.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Iron & Steel Producers', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Midstream']","['73', '110-111']","These extractive industries have substantial environmental impacts, including emissions, land use, and water consumption, making them critical to compare in sustainability reporting.","['b7-coal-operations', 'b9-iron-and-steel-producers', 'b12-oil-and-gas-midstream']"
Metric Selection and Calculation,"When reporting on energy management, which of the following metrics is required for Iron & Steel Producers but not for Oil & Gas - Midstream companies?",Total energy consumed,Percentage grid electricity,Percentage renewable energy,Total fuel consumed,Percentage coal consumption,E. Percentage coal consumption,"Iron & Steel Producers are required to disclose the percentage of fuel consumed that is coal (EM-IS-130a.2), while this specific metric is not required for Oil & Gas - Midstream companies. This reflects the significant use of coal in steel production and the industry-specific nature of energy consumption patterns.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Iron & Steel Producers', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Midstream']","['75-78', '108-113']","These extractive industries have substantial environmental impacts, including emissions, land use, and water consumption, making them critical to compare in sustainability reporting.","['b7-coal-operations', 'b9-iron-and-steel-producers', 'b12-oil-and-gas-midstream']"
Cross-Industry Comparison,Which of the following sustainability topics is explicitly addressed in the IFRS S2 disclosure requirements for Iron & Steel Producers but not for Oil & Gas - Midstream companies?,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,Energy Management,Water Management,Supply Chain Management,Biodiversity Impacts,D. Supply Chain Management,"Supply Chain Management is explicitly addressed as a sustainability disclosure topic for Iron & Steel Producers (EM-IS-430a.1), focusing on the management of iron ore and coking coal sourcing risks. This topic is not explicitly included in the disclosure requirements for Oil & Gas - Midstream companies, reflecting the different supply chain considerations in these industries.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Iron & Steel Producers', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Midstream']","['69-80', '108-113']","These extractive industries have substantial environmental impacts, including emissions, land use, and water consumption, making them critical to compare in sustainability reporting.","['b7-coal-operations', 'b9-iron-and-steel-producers', 'b12-oil-and-gas-midstream']"
Cross-Industry Comparison,"When comparing the activity metrics for Iron & Steel Producers and Oil & Gas - Midstream companies, which of the following is a key difference in their required disclosures?","Iron & Steel Producers report on production volume, while Oil & Gas - Midstream report on transportation volume","Oil & Gas - Midstream report on number of facilities, while Iron & Steel Producers do not","Iron & Steel Producers report on energy consumption, while Oil & Gas - Midstream do not","Oil & Gas - Midstream report on pipeline length, while Iron & Steel Producers report on furnace capacity",Both industries report on the same activity metrics,"A. Iron & Steel Producers report on production volume, while Oil & Gas - Midstream report on transportation volume","A key difference in activity metrics between these industries is that Iron & Steel Producers are required to report on production volumes (e.g., raw steel production, EM-IS-000.A), while Oil & Gas - Midstream companies report on transportation volumes (total metric ton-kilometers of products transported, EM-MD-000.A). This reflects the different core activities of these industries: production for Iron & Steel and transportation for Oil & Gas - Midstream.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Iron & Steel Producers', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Midstream']","['69', '108']","These extractive industries have substantial environmental impacts, including emissions, land use, and water consumption, making them critical to compare in sustainability reporting.","['b7-coal-operations', 'b9-iron-and-steel-producers', 'b12-oil-and-gas-midstream']"
