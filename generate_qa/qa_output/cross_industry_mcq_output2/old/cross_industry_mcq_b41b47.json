    "optionA": "Forestry Management must report Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while Chemicals only reports Scope 1",
    "optionB": "Chemicals must report the percentage of emissions covered under emissions-limiting regulations, while Forestry Management does not",
    "optionC": "Forestry Management reports emissions in CO2 equivalent, while Chemicals reports individual gases separately",
    "optionD": "Chemicals must provide emissions reduction targets, while Forestry Management does not",
    "optionE": "Forestry Management must report emissions from land use change, while Chemicals does not",
    "answer": "B: Chemicals must report the percentage of emissions covered under emissions-limiting regulations, while Forestry Management does not",
    "explanation": "According to the IFRS standards, the Chemicals industry (RT-CH-110a.1) must disclose the percentage of Scope 1 emissions covered under emissions-limiting regulations. This requirement is not present for the Forestry Management industry, which focuses more on describing strategies to manage climate change risks and opportunities (RR-FM-450a.1).",
