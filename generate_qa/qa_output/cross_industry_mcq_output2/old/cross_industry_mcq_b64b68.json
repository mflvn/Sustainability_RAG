    "explanation": "Both car rental/leasing and road transportation industries prioritize fleet fuel economy, but they measure and report it differently. Car rental uses rental day-weighted average fleet fuel economy, while road transportation focuses on total fuel consumed and the percentage of renewable fuels used.",
