    "answer": "D. Energy intensity per unit of production",
    "explanation": "Both the Aerospace & Defense (RT-AE-130a.1) and Electrical & Electronic Equipment (RT-EE-130a.1) industries are required to disclose (1) total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, and (3) percentage renewable energy. They are also required to use higher heating values (HHV) for fuel usage calculations. However, energy intensity per unit of production is not a specified requirement for either industry in the IFRS S2 standards.",

Both industries share requirements for total energy consumed and percentage of grid electricity. The Aerospace & Defense industry specifically requires disclosure of revenue from alternative energy-related products and a description of approach to fuel economy and GHG emissions, which are not explicitly required for Industrial Machinery & Goods in the same format.",

    "answer": "D. Grid electricity from renewable sources outside the entity's control",
    "explanation": "According to the IFRS S2 standard for the Electrical & Electronic Equipment industry (RT-EE-130a.1), the scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel consumed, renewable energy directly produced, and renewable energy purchased through specific agreements that include RECs or GOs. However, it explicitly excludes 'The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity' (3.3.3). Therefore, grid electricity from renewable sources outside the entity's control would not be included in the calculation.",

    "explanation": "According to the IFRS S2 standard for the Industrial Machinery & Goods industry (RT-IG-410a.3), the sales-weighted fuel efficiency for stationary generators is measured in watts per gallon. This metric is calculated as the harmonic mean of design fuel efficiency, capturing the average amount of fuel needed by each generator to produce a given amount of power.",

    "optionE": "There is no significant difference in their approaches to reporting product-related emissions",
    "answer": "C. Industrial Machinery & Goods reports on a wider range of product categories than Aerospace & Defense",
    "explanation": "The Industrial Machinery & Goods industry is required to report sales-weighted emissions for a wider range of product categories, including marine diesel engines, locomotive diesel engines, on-road medium- and heavy-duty engines, and other non-road diesel engines (RT-IG-410a.4). In contrast, the Aerospace & Defense industry focuses more on fuel economy and GHG emissions of products in general, without specifying as many distinct product categories (RT-AE-410a.2). Both industries use sales-weighted metrics and address fuel efficiency, but the Industrial Machinery & Goods industry has more detailed product category breakdowns for emissions reporting.",
