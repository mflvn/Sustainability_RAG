    "explanation": "The IFRS standards require different disclosures for land use and ecological impacts in these industries. Home Builders must report on the number of lots and homes delivered on redevelopment sites (IF-HB-160a.1) and the number of lots located in 100-year flood zones (IF-HB-420a.1). Construction Materials companies, on the other hand, must disclose air emissions of specific pollutants (EM-CM-120a.1) and total fresh water withdrawn, percentage recycled, and percentage in water-stressed regions (EM-CM-140a.1).",

    "explanation": "The energy efficiency metrics differ significantly between the two industries. Home Builders are required to report the 'Number of homes that obtained a certified HERS\u00ae Index Score and average score' (IF-HB-410a.1), which is a specific measure of home energy efficiency. Construction Materials companies, in contrast, must report 'Total energy consumed, percentage grid electricity, percentage alternative, percentage renewable' (EM-CM-130a.1). This reflects the different focus areas for energy efficiency in these industries, with Home Builders concentrating on the efficiency of their final product (homes) and Construction Materials companies focusing on their production processes.",

Construction Materials companies, however, are required to discuss their 'long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets' (EM-CM-110a.2), which emphasizes mitigation rather than adaptation.
