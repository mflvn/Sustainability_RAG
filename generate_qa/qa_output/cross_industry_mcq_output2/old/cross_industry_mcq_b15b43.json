For Asset Management, this relates to the environmental impacts of investee companies, while for Pulp & Paper, it concerns the sourcing of wood fiber and its environmental implications. Forest management is specific to Pulp & Paper, proxy voting to Asset Management, water stress primarily to Pulp & Paper, and financed emissions specifically to Asset Management.",
