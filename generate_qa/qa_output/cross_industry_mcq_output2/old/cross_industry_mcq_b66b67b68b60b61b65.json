    "optionE": "Nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083)",
    "answer": "D. Sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082)",
    "explanation": "According to the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures for all the mentioned transportation industries, companies are required to disclose Scope 1 emissions of the seven GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol. These include carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF\u2083). Sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) is not included in this list and is therefore not required to be reported as part of Scope 1 emissions disclosures.",

The standard specifically states that the calculation methodology for fuel consumed shall be based on actual fuel consumed as opposed to design parameters. Acceptable calculation methodologies include those based on adding fuel purchases to beginning inventory less ending inventory, tracking fuel consumed by vehicles, or tracking fuel expenses. The use of gigajoules as the unit of measurement allows for consistent comparison across different fuel types and transportation modes.",

This approach is applicable across air, sea, and land transportation modes. While other strategies like alternative fuels or electrification may be mentioned for some industries, they are not uniformly applicable or mentioned for all. Route optimization, however, is a versatile strategy that can lead to fuel efficiency improvements and emissions reductions regardless of the specific mode of transportation, making it a common thread across these diverse transportation sectors in their efforts to manage and reduce Scope 1 emissions.",

This metric is also required for the Marine Transportation industry but not for the other transportation industries mentioned. The EEDI is a measure of a ship's energy efficiency, expressed in grams of CO2 per ton-nautical mile. It is specific to maritime vessels and is not applicable to air or land-based transportation modes. While all the mentioned industries are required to report on total fuel consumed, Scope 1 emissions, and strategies to manage emissions, the EEDI is a specialized metric for the maritime sector, reflecting the unique challenges and opportunities for energy efficiency in ship design and operation.",
