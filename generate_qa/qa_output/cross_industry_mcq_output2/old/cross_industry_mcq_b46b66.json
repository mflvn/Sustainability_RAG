    "optionE": "Both industries have identical energy source breakdown requirements",
    "answer": "B: Marine Transportation must report percentage of heavy fuel oil, while Aerospace & Defense does not",
    "explanation": "According to the IFRS standards, the Marine Transportation industry specifically requires reporting the percentage of heavy fuel oil consumed (TR-MT-110a.3), while the Aerospace & Defense industry does not have this requirement. Instead, Aerospace & Defense focuses on grid electricity and renewable energy percentages (RT-AE-130a.1).",

    "answer": "E: The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix outside the entity's control",
    "explanation": "For both industries, the scope of renewable energy explicitly excludes the renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity. This ensures that companies only report on renewable energy they have actively chosen to use or produce.",
