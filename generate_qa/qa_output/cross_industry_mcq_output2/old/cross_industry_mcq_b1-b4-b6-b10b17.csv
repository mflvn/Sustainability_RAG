Reporting Requirements,"According to IFRS standards, which metric is required to be disclosed by both Metals & Mining companies and Insurance companies when reporting on their energy management practices?",Total energy consumed,Percentage grid electricity,Percentage renewable energy,Energy intensity ratio,Carbon emissions per unit of energy,A. Total energy consumed,Both Metals & Mining companies (EM-MM-130a.1) and Insurance companies (FN-IN-410a.2) are required to disclose the total amount of energy consumed as part of their energy management reporting. This metric is common to both industries and allows for a baseline comparison of energy usage across different sectors.,"['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Metals & Mining', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Insurance']","['Page 159', 'Page 86']","These industries all feature extensive supply chains and significant global trade.

Reporting Requirements,"When reporting on water management, what specific metric is required for Metals & Mining companies but not for Insurance companies under IFRS standards?",Total water withdrawn,Total water consumed,Percentage of water in high stress regions,Number of incidents of non-compliance with water quality permits,Water recycling rate,D. Number of incidents of non-compliance with water quality permits,"Metals & Mining companies are required to disclose the number of incidents of non-compliance associated with water quality permits, standards, and regulations (EM-MM-140a.2). This metric is specific to the Metals & Mining industry due to its significant water usage and potential environmental impact. Insurance companies do not have a similar water-specific compliance reporting requirement in their IFRS standards.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Metals & Mining', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Insurance']","['Page 89', 'Page 163-167']","These industries all feature extensive supply chains and significant global trade.

Metric Selection and Calculation,"When calculating the Probable Maximum Loss (PML) for weather-related natural catastrophes, what unique consideration must Insurance companies include that wouldn't apply to Metals & Mining companies?",Geographic location of assets,Historical weather patterns,Reinsurance impact,Asset depreciation rates,Operational downtime,C. Reinsurance impact,"Insurance companies must consider the impact of reinsurance when calculating the Probable Maximum Loss (PML) for weather-related natural catastrophes. They are required to report the PML on both a gross and net of catastrophe reinsurance basis (FN-IN-450a.1). This consideration is unique to the insurance industry and wouldn't apply to Metals & Mining companies, as they don't typically engage in reinsurance practices.",['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Insurance'],['Page 163-164'],"These industries all feature extensive supply chains and significant global trade.

Metric Selection and Calculation,"When reporting on greenhouse gas emissions, what specific calculation is required for Insurance companies but not for Metals & Mining companies under IFRS standards?",Scope 1 emissions,Scope 2 emissions,Scope 3 emissions,Financed emissions,Emissions intensity,D. Financed emissions,"Insurance companies are required to calculate and disclose their financed emissions, which refers to the portion of emissions attributed to their investments and loans (FN-IN-3 and FN-IN-4). This calculation is specific to financial sector companies and is not required for Metals & Mining companies. Metals & Mining companies focus on their direct operational emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) but do not have to account for emissions from their investments.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Insurance', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Metals & Mining']","['Page 170-172', 'Page 82-84']","These industries all feature extensive supply chains and significant global trade.

Cross-Industry Comparison,How do the IFRS sustainability reporting requirements for Metals & Mining companies and Insurance companies differ in their approach to addressing climate-related risks?,Only Metals & Mining companies must report on physical climate risks,Only Insurance companies must report on transition risks,"Metals & Mining focus on operational risks, while Insurance companies address both operational and portfolio risks",Insurance companies only report on liability risks,There are no significant differences in climate risk reporting between the two industries,"C. Metals & Mining focus on operational risks, while Insurance companies address both operational and portfolio risks","Metals & Mining companies primarily focus on operational climate-related risks, such as those affecting their mining and processing activities (EM-MM-110a.2). In contrast, Insurance companies must address both operational risks and risks associated with their investment portfolios, including underwriting risks and financed emissions (FN-IN-450a.3, FN-IN-3, FN-IN-4). This reflects the broader impact of climate change on the insurance industry's business model and financial stability.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Metals & Mining', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Insurance']","['Page 82-84', 'Page 165-167', 'Page 170-172']","These industries all feature extensive supply chains and significant global trade.

Cross-Industry Comparison,"When comparing the sustainability reporting requirements for Metals & Mining companies and Insurance companies, which of the following statements is true regarding their approach to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors?",Only Metals & Mining companies are required to report on ESG factors in their operations,"Insurance companies must report on ESG factors in their investment strategies, while Metals & Mining companies focus solely on environmental factors",Both industries have identical ESG reporting requirements,"Metals & Mining companies report on operational ESG impacts, while Insurance companies report on both operational and investment-related ESG factors",Neither industry is required to report on ESG factors under IFRS standards,"D. Metals & Mining companies report on operational ESG impacts, while Insurance companies report on both operational and investment-related ESG factors","Metals & Mining companies are required to report on ESG factors related to their operations, such as greenhouse gas emissions, energy management, and water management (EM-MM-110a.1, EM-MM-130a.1, EM-MM-140a.1). Insurance companies, in addition to operational ESG factors, must also report on how they incorporate ESG factors into their investment management processes and strategies (FN-IN-410a.2). This reflects the dual role of insurance companies as both operators and significant investors in the economy.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Metals & Mining', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Insurance']","['Page 82-89', 'Page 158-160']","These industries all feature extensive supply chains and significant global trade.
