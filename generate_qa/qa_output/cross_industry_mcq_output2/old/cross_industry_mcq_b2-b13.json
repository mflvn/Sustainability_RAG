    "explanation": "The Appliance Manufacturing industry is required to report on product energy efficiency certifications and end-of-life management (CG-AM-410a.1, CG-AM-410a.2, CG-AM-410a.3), focusing on the use phase and disposal of products. In contrast, the Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing industry is required to report on advanced biofuels and associated infrastructure (EM-RM-410a.2), which addresses the environmental impact of their products during use.
