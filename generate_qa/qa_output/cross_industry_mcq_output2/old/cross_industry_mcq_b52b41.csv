This metric is specific to the climate change adaptation considerations for hotels. In contrast, the Forestry Management industry has different climate-related disclosures, such as describing strategies to manage climate change risks and opportunities (RR-FM-450a.1).","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Hotels & Lodging', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Forestry Management']","['537', '439']","Hotels rely on sustainably-sourced materials from forestry, highlighting the importance of sustainable supply chains and resource efficiency in both sectors.","['b52-hotels-and-lodging', 'b41-forestry-management']"
1,Which of the following disclosures is required for the Forestry Management industry but not for the Hotels & Lodging industry?,Total water consumed,Percentage of renewable energy used,Area of forestland with protected conservation status,Total energy consumed,Average occupancy rate,C: Area of forestland with protected conservation status,"The Forestry Management industry is required to disclose the area of forestland with protected conservation status (RR-FM-160a.2), which is not a requirement for the Hotels & Lodging industry. This metric is specific to the ecosystem services and impacts considerations for forestry management. The Hotels & Lodging industry focuses on different environmental aspects such as energy and water management, and climate change adaptation.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Forestry Management', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Hotels & Lodging']","['439', '537']","Hotels rely on sustainably-sourced materials from forestry, highlighting the importance of sustainable supply chains and resource efficiency in both sectors.","['b52-hotels-and-lodging', 'b41-forestry-management']"
2,"When calculating the percentage of renewable energy consumed for the Hotels & Lodging industry, which of the following sources should NOT be included?",On-site solar panels with retained RECs,Purchased electricity through a Green-e Energy Certified utility program,Renewable energy from biomass sources certified by the Forest Stewardship Council,Wind energy purchased through a PPA with explicit inclusion of RECs,The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix outside the entity's control,E: The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix outside the entity's control,"According to the IFRS standard for Hotels & Lodging (SV-HL-130a.1), the renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of renewable energy.

2,"In the Forestry Management industry, when calculating the area of forestland certified to third-party forest management standards, what should a company do if a forestland area is certified to multiple standards?","Count the area multiple times, once for each certification",Only count the area under the most stringent certification,Average the area across all certifications,"Count the area only once in the total, but disclose the percentage for each standard",Exclude the area from the calculation entirely,"D: Count the area only once in the total, but disclose the percentage for each standard","According to the IFRS standard for Forestry Management (RR-FM-160a.1), if a forestland area is certified to multiple certification standards, the entity shall not account for the acreage more than once when calculating the total forestland area certified. However, the entity shall disclose the percentage of the total certified forestland that is certified to each forest management standard.",['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Forestry Management'],['439'],"Hotels rely on sustainably-sourced materials from forestry, highlighting the importance of sustainable supply chains and resource efficiency in both sectors.","['b52-hotels-and-lodging', 'b41-forestry-management']"
3,How do the climate change adaptation considerations differ between the Hotels & Lodging and Forestry Management industries?,"Hotels focus on flood risks, while forestry focuses on fire risks","Hotels consider only short-term impacts, while forestry considers long-term impacts","Hotels quantify physical risks, while forestry only describes qualitative impacts","Hotels address only coastal risks, while forestry addresses inland risks","Hotels focus on property damage, while forestry focuses on productivity changes","E: Hotels focus on property damage, while forestry focuses on productivity changes","The climate change adaptation considerations differ significantly between these industries. For Hotels & Lodging, the focus is on physical risks to properties, such as damage from flooding and inclement weather, which could impact asset values and revenues (SV-HL-450a.1). In contrast, the Forestry Management industry focuses on how climate change could affect forest productivity, including changes in growth rates, pest migrations, and fire frequency, which could impact timber yield and overall forest health (RR-FM-450a.1).","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Hotels & Lodging', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Forestry Management']","['543', '444']","Hotels rely on sustainably-sourced materials from forestry, highlighting the importance of sustainable supply chains and resource efficiency in both sectors.","['b52-hotels-and-lodging', 'b41-forestry-management']"

In contrast, the Hotels & Lodging industry standards do not include specific metrics or disclosures related to ecosystem services. The hotel industry focuses more on energy and water management, and climate change adaptation in terms of physical risks to properties.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Forestry Management', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Hotels & Lodging']","['439', '442', '537']","Hotels rely on sustainably-sourced materials from forestry, highlighting the importance of sustainable supply chains and resource efficiency in both sectors.","['b52-hotels-and-lodging', 'b41-forestry-management']"
