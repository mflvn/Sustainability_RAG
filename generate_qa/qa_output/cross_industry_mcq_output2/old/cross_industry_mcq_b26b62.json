    "question": "When calculating the percentage of renewable energy consumed, what is a common consideration for both the Restaurants and Auto Parts industries?",
    "optionA": "Including only solar and wind energy sources",
    "optionB": "Excluding all grid electricity from the calculation",
    "optionC": "Considering only energy produced on-site",
    "optionD": "Including renewable energy purchased through PPAs with explicit RECs or GOs",
    "optionE": "Calculating based on cost rather than energy content",
    "answer": "D. Including renewable energy purchased through PPAs with explicit RECs or GOs",
    "explanation": "Both industries share the same consideration for calculating renewable energy percentage. They should include renewable energy purchased through power purchase agreements (PPAs) that explicitly include renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs). This ensures that only verifiable renewable energy sources are counted in the percentage calculation.",

    "answer": "C. Restaurants report on certified products, while Auto Parts have no such requirement",
    "explanation": "The Restaurants industry (FB-RN-430a.1) requires reporting on the percentage of food purchased that is certified to third-party environmental and/or social standards. In contrast, the Auto Parts industry (TR-AP-410a.1) focuses on revenue from products designed to increase fuel efficiency and/or reduce emissions, without a specific certification requirement. This reflects the different nature of sustainability concerns in these industries.",
