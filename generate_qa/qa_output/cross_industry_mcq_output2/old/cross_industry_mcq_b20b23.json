    "optionA": "Only the Agricultural Products industry needs to report Scope 1 emissions",
    "optionB": "The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry must report emissions from enteric fermentation separately",
    "optionC": "The Agricultural Products industry must report fleet fuel consumption, while the Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry does not",
    "optionD": "Only the Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry needs to discuss emission reduction targets",
    "optionE": "The Agricultural Products industry must report Scope 2 emissions, while the Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry does not",
    "answer": "C. The Agricultural Products industry must report fleet fuel consumption, while the Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry does not",
    "explanation": "The key difference in greenhouse gas emissions reporting between these industries is that the Agricultural Products industry is specifically required to disclose fleet fuel consumed and the percentage of renewable fuel under metric FB-AG-110a.3. This requirement is not present for the Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry. Both industries are required to report Scope 1 emissions and discuss emission reduction strategies and targets.",

    "explanation": "While both industries have similar requirements for reporting on water withdrawal, consumption, and management strategies, the Agricultural Products industry has a unique requirement (FB-AG-440a.2) to disclose the percentage of agricultural products sourced from regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress. This requirement is not present in the Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry disclosures, which instead focus on animal feed and contract producers in water-stressed regions.",

    "answer": "E. Biomass energy",
    "explanation": "For both industries, the IFRS standards explicitly limit the scope of renewable energy from biomass sources. The standards state that energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a third-party standard, materials considered eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for Renewable Energy Certification, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state renewable portfolio standard. This limitation is not applied to other renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydroelectric, or geothermal.",

    "answer": "B. The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry has specific requirements for reporting on animal litter and manure management",
    "explanation": "The key difference in land use and ecological impact reporting between these industries is that the Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry has specific requirements for reporting on animal litter and manure management (FB-MP-160a.1). This includes disclosing the amount of animal litter and manure generated and the percentage managed according to a nutrient management plan. The Agricultural Products industry does not have a similar requirement, as it focuses more on crop production rather than animal waste management.",

    "explanation": "The key difference in climate change risk reporting between these industries is in the scope of their required disclosures. The Agricultural Products industry must identify principal crops and describe risks and opportunities presented by climate change (FB-AG-440a.1). In contrast, the Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry must discuss strategy to manage opportunities and risks to both feed sourcing and livestock supply presented by climate change (FB-MP-440a.3).
