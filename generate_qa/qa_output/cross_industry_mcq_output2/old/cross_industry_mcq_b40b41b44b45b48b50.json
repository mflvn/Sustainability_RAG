    "question": "In the context of water management reporting, what is a key difference between the requirements for the Solar Technology & Project Developers industry and the Containers & Packaging industry?",
    "optionA": "Only Solar Technology & Project Developers must report water consumption",
    "optionB": "Containers & Packaging must report incidents of non-compliance with water regulations",
    "optionC": "Solar Technology & Project Developers are not required to discuss water management strategies",
    "optionD": "Only Containers & Packaging must report water withdrawn from high stress regions",
    "optionE": "Solar Technology & Project Developers don't need to disclose total water withdrawn",
    "answer": "B: Containers & Packaging must report incidents of non-compliance with water regulations",
    "explanation": "A key difference in water management reporting between these industries is that the Containers & Packaging industry (RT-CP-140a.3) explicitly requires reporting on the number of incidents of non-compliance associated with water quality permits, standards, and regulations. This requirement is not present in the Solar Technology & Project Developers industry disclosures, which focus more on water withdrawal, consumption, and management strategies without specific mention of compliance incidents.",

    "qa_type": "Metric Selection and Calculation",
    "question": "When calculating the percentage of renewable energy consumed, which of the following is considered within scope for both the Solar Technology & Project Developers and the Industrial Machinery & Goods industries?",
    "optionA": "All electricity from the grid mix labeled as 'green' by the utility",
    "optionB": "Renewable energy certificates (RECs) purchased without associated electricity",

    "optionD": "Renewable energy generated on-site but with RECs sold to other entities",
    "optionE": "All hydroelectric power, regardless of environmental impact",
    "answer": "C: Energy from biomass sources certified to a third-party standard",
    "explanation": "Both industries consider energy from biomass sources within the scope of renewable energy, but with the specific limitation that it must be certified to a third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable Forest Initiative). This requirement ensures that only sustainably sourced biomass energy is counted as renewable, reflecting a consistent approach to defining renewable energy across these industries.",
