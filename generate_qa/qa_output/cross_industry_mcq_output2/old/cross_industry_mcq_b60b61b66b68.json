    "explanation": "Both Airlines (TR-AL-110a.1) and Marine Transportation (TR-MT-110a.1) companies are required to disclose their gross global Scope 1 emissions according to IFRS standards. This metric is common across these transportation industries as it provides a standardized measure of direct GHG emissions from owned or controlled sources.",

    "optionA": "Road Transportation uses a lifecycle GHG reduction criterion, while Airlines do not",

    "answer": "A. Road Transportation uses a lifecycle GHG reduction criterion, while Airlines do not",
    "explanation": "For Road Transportation (TR-RO-110a.3), renewable fuel must achieve net emission reduction on a lifecycle basis that is at least 20 percent less than baseline lifecycle GHG emissions. The Airlines industry (TR-AL-110a.3) definition of sustainable fuel does not specify a quantitative lifecycle GHG reduction criterion, instead focusing on avoiding competition with food and water and contributing to local social and economic development.",

    "optionC": "Number of departures",
    "optionD": "Load factor",

    "explanation": "Load factor is an activity metric common to both Airlines (TR-AL-000.B) and Road Transportation (TR-RO-000.B) industries. It measures capacity utilization, although calculated slightly differently for each industry. For airlines, it's calculated as passenger kilometers traveled divided by available seat kilometers, while for road transportation, it's cargo miles traveled divided by total miles traveled. This metric helps both industries assess operational efficiency.",
