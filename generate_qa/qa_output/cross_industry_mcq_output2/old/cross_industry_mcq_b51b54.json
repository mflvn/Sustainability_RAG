    "optionA": "Percentage of renewable energy consumed",
    "optionB": "Total energy consumed",
    "optionC": "Percentage of grid electricity consumed",
    "optionD": "Number of active online gaming customers",
    "optionE": "Weight of end-of-life products recovered",
    "answer": "B: Total energy consumed",
    "explanation": "According to the IFRS standards, the Casinos & Gaming industry is required to disclose total energy consumed as part of the Energy Management topic (metric SV-CA-130a.1). While the Electronic Manufacturing Services & Original Design Manufacturing industry doesn't have an explicit energy consumption metric listed in the provided content, total energy consumed is a fundamental sustainability metric that would likely be included in their overall reporting. The other options are either specific to one industry or not mentioned as required disclosures for both.",
