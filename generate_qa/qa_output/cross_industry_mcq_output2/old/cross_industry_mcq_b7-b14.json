    "explanation": "Coal operations companies are required to disclose the sensitivity of their coal reserve levels to future price projection scenarios that account for a price on carbon emissions (EM-CO-420a.1). This is not a requirement for oil and gas services companies, as they typically do not own reserves. Oil and gas services companies have different disclosure requirements focused on their operations and services.",

This level of detail regarding carbon pricing and its impact on reserve valuation is not present in the requirements for oil and gas services companies, likely because they typically do not own reserves. This reflects the different roles these industries play in the energy sector and their varying exposure to carbon pricing risks.",
