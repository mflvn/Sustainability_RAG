    "optionB": "Percentage of renewable energy consumed",
    "optionC": "Total water withdrawn",

    "optionE": "Network traffic in petabytes",
    "answer": "C: Total water withdrawn",
    "explanation": "Both Internet Media & Services (TC-IM-130a.2) and Software & IT Services (TC-SI-130a.2) are required to disclose total water withdrawn, while this metric is not listed as a requirement for Telecommunication Services companies in the provided standards. All three industries are required to report on total energy consumed and percentage of renewable energy, while network traffic is specific to Telecommunication Services and performance issues are not universally required across all three.",

    "qa_type": "Reporting Requirements",
    "question": "When disclosing information about renewable energy consumption, what specific requirement is common to Internet Media & Services, Software & IT Services, and Telecommunication Services industries?",
    "optionA": "Only grid-supplied renewable energy can be included",
    "optionB": "Renewable energy certificates (RECs) must be sold to claim renewable energy use",
    "optionC": "Biomass energy sources must be certified by a third-party standard",
    "optionD": "Renewable energy can only be claimed if generated on-site",
    "optionE": "The renewable portion of the general electricity grid mix can always be claimed",
    "answer": "C: Biomass energy sources must be certified by a third-party standard",
    "explanation": "For all three industries, the standards specify that for the purposes of renewable energy disclosure, energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable Forest Initiative, etc.) or those considered eligible according to specific green energy frameworks or state renewable portfolio standards.",

    "optionA": "Renewable fuel directly consumed by the entity",
    "optionB": "Renewable energy directly produced by the entity",
    "optionC": "Renewable energy purchased through a PPA with explicit RECs",
    "optionD": "Green-e Energy Certified utility program purchases",
    "optionE": "The renewable portion of the general electricity grid mix",
    "answer": "E: The renewable portion of the general electricity grid mix",
    "explanation": "For all three industries, the standards explicitly state that 'The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of renewable energy.' This means companies cannot claim the general renewable portion of the grid mix in their calculations unless they have specifically purchased or contracted for renewable energy.",

    "answer": "C: Internet Media & Services focus on data center risks, while Telecommunication Services focus on network infrastructure risks",
    "explanation": "While both industries are required to discuss business continuity risks, the focus differs. Internet Media & Services companies are specifically required to discuss 'the integration of environmental considerations into strategic planning for data center needs' (TC-IM-130a.3). In contrast, Telecommunication Services companies must discuss 'business continuity risks associated with technology disruptions affecting operations,' with a focus on network infrastructure and service interruptions (TC-TL-550a.2).",

Both industries report on data processing capacity and data storage, but the specific subscriber metrics differ, with Telecommunication Services focusing on wireless, wireline, and broadband subscribers.",
