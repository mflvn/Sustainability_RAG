    "explanation": "The Biofuels industry has specific reporting considerations for feedstock production, including land use change, biodiversity, and soil health (RR-BI-430a.1). In contrast, the Metals & Mining industry focuses more on extraction methods, water usage, and energy consumption in its raw material sourcing (EM-MM-130a.1, EM-MM-140a.1).
