    "optionA": "Description of environmental risks associated with sourcing raw materials",
    "optionB": "Percentage of raw materials third-party certified to sustainability standards",
    "optionC": "Gross global Scope 1 emissions",
    "optionD": "Number of Tier 1 suppliers",
    "optionE": "Total fresh water withdrawn",
    "answer": "C: Gross global Scope 1 emissions",
    "explanation": "The Coal Operations industry is required to disclose gross global Scope 1 emissions (EM-CO-110a.1), while this is not a specified requirement for the Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry. Both industries have requirements related to environmental risks and water management, but Scope 1 emissions are specifically mandated for Coal Operations due to the carbon-intensive nature of their activities.",

    "explanation": "Both industries are required to disclose information about water management. For Apparel, Accessories & Footwear, this is part of the environmental risks associated with sourcing raw materials (CG-AA-440a.1). For Coal Operations, it's explicitly required in EM-CO-140a.1. While the specific metrics might differ slightly, both industries need to report on their water usage due to the significant water-related impacts in their operations.",

    "answer": "A: Apparel focuses on supplier certifications, while Coal focuses on emissions",
    "explanation": "The Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry measures supply chain sustainability through metrics like the percentage of raw materials third-party certified to environmental and/or social sustainability standards (CG-AA-440a.2). In contrast, the Coal Operations industry focuses more on emissions-related metrics, such as gross global Scope 1 emissions (EM-CO-110a.1), reflecting the different nature of sustainability challenges in these industries.",

    "optionE": "Both industries use identical water-related metrics and calculations",
    "answer": "D: Coal reports more detailed water metrics, including stress and quality compliance",
    "explanation": "The Coal Operations industry has more detailed water-related metrics. It requires reporting on total fresh water withdrawn, percentage recycled, percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress (EM-CO-140a.1), and incidents of non-compliance with water quality permits (EM-CO-140a.2). The Apparel industry's water-related disclosures are less specific, mainly covered under the broader environmental risks associated with sourcing raw materials (CG-AA-440a.1).",

    "explanation": "The Coal Operations industry faces significant challenges related to direct emissions, as evidenced by the requirement to report gross global Scope 1 emissions (EM-CO-110a.1) and strategies to manage these emissions (EM-CO-110a.2). In contrast, the Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry's climate-related challenges are more focused on the supply chain, particularly in sourcing raw materials (CG-AA-440a.1).

    "answer": "D: Estimating the impact of climate regulation on asset valuation",
    "explanation": "The Coal Operations industry faces a unique challenge in estimating the impact of climate regulation on asset valuation, as evidenced by the requirement to discuss how price and demand for coal and/or climate regulation influence the capital expenditure strategy for exploration, acquisition, and development of assets (EM-CO-420a.3). This challenge is more prominent for Coal Operations due to the direct link between climate regulation and the long-term viability of coal reserves. The Apparel industry, while facing its own sustainability challenges, does not have this specific requirement related to climate regulation and asset valuation.",
