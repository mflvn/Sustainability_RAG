    "answer": "C: Household & Personal Products focus on palm oil, while Processed Foods cover all food ingredients",
    "explanation": "The IFRS standards show a key difference in supply chain reporting between these industries. The Household & Personal Products industry has specific requirements for reporting on palm oil sourcing and RSPO certification (CG-HP-430a.1). In contrast, the Processed Foods industry has broader requirements covering all food ingredients, including the percentage certified to third-party environmental and/or social standards (FB-PF-430a.1) and supplier audit results (FB-PF-430a.2). This reflects the different supply chain priorities and impacts of each industry.",

    "explanation": "A key difference in water management disclosures between these industries is that the Processed Foods industry is specifically required to report the 'Number of incidents of non-compliance associated with water quantity and/or quality permits, standards, and regulations' (FB-PF-140a.2). This requirement is not present for the Household & Personal Products industry. Both industries share similar requirements for reporting total water withdrawn and consumed, percentages in water-stressed areas, and descriptions of water management risks and strategies. This additional metric for Processed Foods reflects the industry's particular regulatory risks related to water use and discharge in food processing operations.",
