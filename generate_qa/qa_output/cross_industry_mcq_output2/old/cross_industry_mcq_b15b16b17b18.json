    "optionA": "Only Commercial Banks need to disclose Scope 3 emissions",
    "optionB": "Asset Management companies must disclose emissions intensity, while Commercial Banks do not",
    "optionC": "Commercial Banks must disclose undrawn loan commitments separately, while Asset Management companies do not have this requirement",
    "optionD": "Asset Management companies need to disclose emissions for all industries, while Commercial Banks only report on carbon-related industries",
    "optionE": "Commercial Banks report on a cash basis, while Asset Management companies use accrual accounting for emissions",
    "answer": "C: Commercial Banks must disclose undrawn loan commitments separately, while Asset Management companies do not have this requirement",
    "explanation": "According to the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures, Commercial Banks are required to disclose undrawn loan commitments separately when reporting on financed emissions (FN-CB-2, FN-CB-3). This requirement is not present for Asset Management & Custody Activities companies. Both industries are required to disclose Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, as well as emissions for all industries, not just carbon-related ones.",

    "explanation": "According to the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures, Investment Banking & Brokerage firms are required to disclose facilitated emissions in relation to their revenue from key business lines (FN-IB-1). In contrast, Commercial Banks report financed emissions in relation to their gross exposure, including funded amounts and undrawn loan commitments (FN-CB-3). This difference reflects the distinct nature of their business models and how they contribute to or facilitate emissions through their activities.",
