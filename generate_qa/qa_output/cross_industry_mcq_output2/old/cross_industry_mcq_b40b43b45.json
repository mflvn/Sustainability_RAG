    "optionA": "Total water withdrawn only",
    "optionB": "Total water consumed only",
    "optionC": "Percentage of water withdrawn in water-stressed regions only",
    "optionD": "Total water withdrawn, total water consumed, and percentage of each in water-stressed regions",
    "optionE": "Total wastewater discharged and treated",
    "answer": "D: Total water withdrawn, total water consumed, and percentage of each in water-stressed regions",
    "explanation": "Both the Biofuels (RR-BI-140a.1) and Pulp & Paper Products (RR-PP-140a.1) industries are required to disclose total water withdrawn, total water consumed, and the percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress according to IFRS S2. This comprehensive approach allows for a better understanding of the water impact and risks in these water-intensive industries.",

    "answer": "C: Biofuels must disclose lifecycle GHG emissions by biofuel type, while Pulp & Paper Products only disclose gross global Scope 1 emissions",
    "explanation": "The Biofuels industry has a specific requirement (RR-BI-410a.1) to disclose lifecycle GHG emissions by biofuel type, reflecting the importance of understanding the full environmental impact of biofuel production and use. In contrast, the Pulp & Paper Products industry is required to disclose gross global Scope 1 emissions (RR-PP-110a.1), which focuses on direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. This difference highlights the unique sustainability considerations for each industry.",

    "answer": "C: Biofuels focus on feedstock sustainability, while Pulp & Paper Products focus on forest management certification",
    "explanation": "The key difference in supply chain management disclosures between the Biofuels and Pulp & Paper Products industries lies in their focus areas. The Biofuels industry (RR-BI-430a.1, RR-BI-430a.2) emphasizes disclosing strategies to manage risks associated with environmental impacts of feedstock production and the percentage of production certified to environmental sustainability standards. In contrast, the Pulp & Paper Products industry (RR-PP-430a.1, RR-PP-430a.2) focuses on disclosing the percentage of wood fiber sourced from certified forestlands and the amount of recycled and recovered fiber procured.
