Reporting Requirements,"When reporting on energy management, what is a key difference in the disclosure requirements between Health Care Delivery and Mortgage Finance industries?","Health Care Delivery must report total energy consumed, while Mortgage Finance does not","Mortgage Finance must report energy use in mortgaged properties, while Health Care Delivery reports on its own facilities","Health Care Delivery must report percentage of renewable energy, while Mortgage Finance does not","Mortgage Finance must report energy efficiency of financed properties, while Health Care Delivery reports on its own operations",There are no differences in energy reporting requirements between these industries,"C: Health Care Delivery must report percentage of renewable energy, while Mortgage Finance does not","According to the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures, Health Care Delivery companies are required to disclose total energy consumed, percentage grid electricity, and percentage renewable energy (HC-DY-130a.1). In contrast, the Mortgage Finance industry does not have a specific requirement to report on energy consumption or renewable energy percentages. Instead, their focus is on environmental risks to mortgaged properties.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Health Care Delivery', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Mortgage Finance']","['283', '185-187']","The financing of large capital projects like hospitals intersects with sustainability in terms of energy use, construction materials, and community impact.","['b19-mortgage-finance', 'b28-health-care-delivery']"
Reporting Requirements,What is a key similarity in climate-related disclosure requirements for both Health Care Delivery and Mortgage Finance industries?,Both must report on total carbon emissions from their operations,Both must disclose strategies for reducing energy consumption,Both must report on the physical risks due to increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events,Both must disclose the percentage of renewable energy used in their operations,Both must report on water consumption and management strategies,C: Both must report on the physical risks due to increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events,"Both Health Care Delivery and Mortgage Finance industries are required to address physical risks related to extreme weather events.
