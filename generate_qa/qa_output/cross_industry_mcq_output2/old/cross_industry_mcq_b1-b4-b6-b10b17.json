They are required to report the PML on both a gross and net of catastrophe reinsurance basis (FN-IN-450a.1). This consideration is unique to the insurance industry and wouldn't apply to Metals & Mining companies, as they don't typically engage in reinsurance practices.",

    "explanation": "Metals & Mining companies primarily focus on operational climate-related risks, such as those affecting their mining and processing activities (EM-MM-110a.2). In contrast, Insurance companies must address both operational risks and risks associated with their investment portfolios, including underwriting risks and financed emissions (FN-IN-450a.3, FN-IN-3, FN-IN-4). This reflects the broader impact of climate change on the insurance industry's business model and financial stability.",
