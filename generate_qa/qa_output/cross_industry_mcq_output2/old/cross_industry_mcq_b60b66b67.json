    "optionA": "Only Air Freight & Logistics companies need to report Scope 1 emissions",
    "optionB": "Marine Transportation companies must report emissions from refrigerants, while Air Freight & Logistics companies do not",
    "optionC": "Air Freight & Logistics companies must report fuel consumed by road transport, while Marine Transportation companies report fuel consumed by vessels",
    "optionD": "Marine Transportation companies are exempt from reporting emissions reduction targets",
    "optionE": "Only Air Freight & Logistics companies need to disclose the calculation methodology for emissions",
    "answer": "C: Air Freight & Logistics companies must report fuel consumed by road transport, while Marine Transportation companies report fuel consumed by vessels",
    "explanation": "While both industries are required to report on Scope 1 emissions, there is a key difference in the specific fuel consumption disclosures. Air Freight & Logistics companies must report fuel consumed by road transport, including percentages of natural gas and renewable fuel. In contrast, Marine Transportation companies must report total energy consumed, with a focus on the percentage of heavy fuel oil and renewable energy used in their vessels.",

    "optionA": "Only Rail Transportation companies need to disclose long-term and short-term strategies",
    "optionB": "Marine Transportation companies are not required to discuss emission reduction targets",
    "optionC": "Rail Transportation companies must include trip optimization in their strategy discussion, while Marine Transportation companies must include route optimization",

    "answer": "C: Rail Transportation companies must include trip optimization in their strategy discussion, while Marine Transportation companies must include route optimization",
    "explanation": "While both industries are required to discuss long-term and short-term strategies for managing Scope 1 emissions, there are industry-specific elements they must include. Rail Transportation companies are explicitly required to discuss operational improvements such as trip optimization, while Marine Transportation companies are expected to include route optimization in their strategy discussion. This reflects the different operational contexts and emission reduction opportunities specific to each industry.",

    "answer": "E: Air Freight & Logistics companies must separate road and air transport in their renewable fuel calculations",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in the granularity of reporting. Air Freight & Logistics companies are required to separately disclose the percentage of renewable fuel for road transport and the percentage of sustainable fuel for air transport. In contrast, Rail Transportation companies report a single percentage for all fuel consumed. Both industries use similar definitions for renewable fuel and are required to disclose the standard used to determine if a fuel is renewable.",

    "explanation": "The key difference is in the scope of energy sources included in the calculation. Rail Transportation companies are required to disclose the total amount of fuel consumed from all sources, including renewable sources. In contrast, Marine Transportation companies focus specifically on the percentage of heavy fuel oil and renewable energy in their total energy consumption. Both industries use higher heating values (HHV) for calculations and report energy in gigajoules (GJ).",

    "explanation": "While both industries share many common reporting requirements such as Scope 1 emissions, emission reduction strategies, and renewable energy use, the Marine Transportation industry has a unique requirement to disclose the average Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for new ships. This metric, measured in grams of CO2 per ton-nautical mile, is specific to the shipping industry and reflects the energy efficiency of vessel design, which is not applicable to the Air Freight & Logistics industry.",

    "explanation": "The key difference in activity metrics is that Rail Transportation companies are required to report on track miles, which includes route miles and takes into account multiple track routes. This metric is unique to the rail industry and not applicable to Air Freight & Logistics. Both industries report on similar metrics such as the number of employees and measures of freight volume and distance (e.g., revenue ton miles for Rail Transportation and revenue ton kilometers for Air Freight & Logistics), but the track miles metric is specific to Rail Transportation due to the fixed infrastructure nature of the industry.",
