In contrast, the Engineering & Construction Services industry does not have a directly comparable metric for water consumption. Instead, it focuses on incorporating water efficiency considerations into project planning and design (IF-EN-410a.2), reflecting the different roles these industries play in water use and management.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Meat, Poultry & Dairy', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Engineering & Construction Services']","['235-238', '329-330']","['b23-meat-poultry-and-dairy', 'b33-engineering-and-construction-services']",Both industries have a large environmental footprint and their sustainability strategies can benefit from cross-sector learnings on resource use and regulation compliance.
Metric Selection and Calculation,"In assessing climate-related financial impacts, what metric is unique to the Engineering & Construction Services industry compared to the Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry?",Scope 1 emissions,Energy consumption from renewables,Water withdrawal in stressed areas,Amount of backlog cancellations associated with hydrocarbon-related projects,Animal feed sourced from water-stressed regions,D: Amount of backlog cancellations associated with hydrocarbon-related projects,"The Engineering & Construction Services industry has a unique metric (IF-EN-410b.2) that requires disclosure of the amount of backlog cancellations associated with hydrocarbon-related projects. This metric is specific to the industry's project-based nature and its involvement in energy infrastructure. The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry does not have a comparable metric, as it is not typically involved in large-scale energy projects.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Meat, Poultry & Dairy', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Engineering & Construction Services']","['230-232', '332-333']","['b23-meat-poultry-and-dairy', 'b33-engineering-and-construction-services']",Both industries have a large environmental footprint and their sustainability strategies can benefit from cross-sector learnings on resource use and regulation compliance.
Cross-Industry Comparison,"How do the Meat, Poultry & Dairy and Engineering & Construction Services industries differ in their approach to reporting on climate change mitigation efforts?","Only Meat, Poultry & Dairy reports on climate change mitigation","Engineering & Construction Services focuses on project-specific mitigation, while Meat, Poultry & Dairy focuses on operational mitigation","Meat, Poultry & Dairy reports on carbon offsets, while Engineering & Construction Services does not","Engineering & Construction Services only reports on energy efficiency, not climate mitigation",Both industries have identical climate change mitigation reporting requirements,"B: Engineering & Construction Services focuses on project-specific mitigation, while Meat, Poultry & Dairy focuses on operational mitigation","The Engineering & Construction Services industry reports on climate change mitigation through project-specific metrics, such as backlog for non-energy projects associated with climate change mitigation (IF-EN-410b.3). In contrast, the Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry focuses on operational mitigation strategies, such as managing Scope 1 emissions (FB-MP-110a.2). This difference reflects the distinct roles these industries play in addressing climate change.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Meat, Poultry & Dairy', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Engineering & Construction Services']","['231-232', '333-334']","['b23-meat-poultry-and-dairy', 'b33-engineering-and-construction-services']",Both industries have a large environmental footprint and their sustainability strategies can benefit from cross-sector learnings on resource use and regulation compliance.
