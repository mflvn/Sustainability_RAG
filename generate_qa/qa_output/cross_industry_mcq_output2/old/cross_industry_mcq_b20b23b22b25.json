This is not a requirement for the Agricultural Products industry, as refrigerant use is less significant in their operations. This disclosure is important for Food Retailers & Distributors due to the potential climate impact of refrigerant emissions in their extensive cold storage and display systems.",

    "explanation": "For both the Processed Foods (FB-PF-440a.1) and Meat, Poultry & Dairy (FB-MP-440a.1) industries, the correct denominator for calculating the percentage of food ingredients sourced from water-stressed regions is the total cost of food ingredients purchased from Tier 1 suppliers.

    "optionA": "Only Agricultural Products must report on Scope 1 emissions",

    "answer": "D. Food Retailers & Distributors must report on refrigerant emissions, while Agricultural Products do not",
    "explanation": "The key difference in GHG emissions reporting between these industries is that Food Retailers & Distributors must specifically report on gross global Scope 1 emissions from refrigerants (FB-FR-110b.1), while this is not a requirement for Agricultural Products. This reflects the significant use of refrigeration in retail and distribution operations, which is less relevant in agricultural production. Both industries are required to report on overall Scope 1 emissions and emission reduction strategies, but the specific focus on refrigerants is unique to Food Retailers & Distributors.",

In contrast, the Processed Foods industry reports on general food ingredient sourcing (FB-PF-440a.1, FB-PF-440a.2), without a specific focus on animal feed. This reflects the different priorities and risks in their respective supply chains, with animal feed being a critical input for Meat, Poultry & Dairy production.",
