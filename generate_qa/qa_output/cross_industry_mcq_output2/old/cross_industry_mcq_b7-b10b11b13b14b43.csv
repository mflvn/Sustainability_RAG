Reporting Requirements,"According to IFRS standards, which of the following is a required disclosure for companies in the Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production industry but NOT for companies in the Pulp & Paper Products industry?",Total energy consumed,Percentage of energy from renewable sources,Gross global Scope 1 emissions,Volume of produced water and flowback generated,Water consumption in water-stressed areas,D. Volume of produced water and flowback generated,"The Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production industry specifically requires disclosure of the volume of produced water and flowback generated (EM-EP-140a.2), while this is not a requirement for the Pulp & Paper Products industry. Both industries are required to disclose total energy consumed, percentage of renewable energy, gross global Scope 1 emissions, and water consumption in water-stressed areas.","These industries involve significant extraction and processing of natural resources. Comparing their sustainability practices is insightful to address environmental degradation, resource efficiency, and social impacts on local communities.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Exploration & Production', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Pulp & Paper Products']","['99', '456']","['b7-coal-operations', 'b10-metals-and-mining', 'b11-oil-and-gas-exploration-and-production', 'b13-oil-and-gas-refining-and-marketing', 'b14-oil-and-gas-services', 'b43-pulp-and-paper-products']"
Reporting Requirements,Which of the following disclosures is required for the Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing industry but NOT for the Coal Operations industry?,Gross global Scope 1 emissions,Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy to manage Scope 1 emissions,Total fresh water withdrawn,Percentage of water recycled,Total addressable market for advanced biofuels,E. Total addressable market for advanced biofuels,"The Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing industry specifically requires disclosure of the total addressable market for advanced biofuels (EM-RM-410a.2), which is not a requirement for the Coal Operations industry. Both industries are required to disclose gross global Scope 1 emissions, strategies to manage emissions, and water management metrics.","These industries involve significant extraction and processing of natural resources.

Metric Selection and Calculation,"When calculating the percentage of engines that meet emissions standards in the Oil & Gas - Services industry, which of the following is the correct denominator?",Total number of engines owned by the company,Total number of active engines during the reporting period,Total number of engines manufactured in the reporting year,Total number of engines in compliance with any emissions standard,Total number of engines used in offshore operations,B. Total number of active engines during the reporting period,"According to EM-SV-110a.3, the percentage is calculated as the number of engines in compliance with the highest level of emissions standards divided by the total number of engines active during the reporting period.","These industries involve significant extraction and processing of natural resources. Comparing their sustainability practices is insightful to address environmental degradation, resource efficiency, and social impacts on local communities.",['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Services'],['128-129'],"['b7-coal-operations', 'b10-metals-and-mining', 'b11-oil-and-gas-exploration-and-production', 'b13-oil-and-gas-refining-and-marketing', 'b14-oil-and-gas-services', 'b43-pulp-and-paper-products']"
Metric Selection and Calculation,"In the Pulp & Paper Products industry, how should a company calculate the percentage of recycled fiber content in its products?",Weight of recycled fiber / Total weight of all fiber used,Volume of recycled fiber / Total volume of all fiber used,Cost of recycled fiber / Total cost of all fiber used,Number of products with recycled content / Total number of products,Weight of post-consumer recycled fiber / Total weight of all fiber used,A. Weight of recycled fiber / Total weight of all fiber used,"According to RR-PP-430a.2, recycled content is defined as the portion, by mass, of recycled or recovered material in a product. The calculation should be based on the weight of recycled fiber divided by the total weight of all fiber used.","These industries involve significant extraction and processing of natural resources.

Cross-Industry Comparison,"Which of the following sustainability considerations is MOST likely to be a shared focus across the Coal Operations, Oil & Gas - Exploration & Production, and Pulp & Paper Products industries?",Biodiversity impact of resource extraction,Management of Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions,Recycled content in finished products,Flaring and venting of natural gas,Certification of raw material sources,B. Management of Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions,"Management of Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions is a key sustainability consideration shared by all three industries. Each industry standard requires disclosure of gross global Scope 1 emissions and discussion of strategies to manage these emissions, reflecting the universal importance of climate change mitigation across these sectors.","These industries involve significant extraction and processing of natural resources. Comparing their sustainability practices is insightful to address environmental degradation, resource efficiency, and social impacts on local communities.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Coal Operations', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Exploration & Production', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Pulp & Paper Products']","['43-45', '93-94', '456-458']","['b7-coal-operations', 'b10-metals-and-mining', 'b11-oil-and-gas-exploration-and-production', 'b13-oil-and-gas-refining-and-marketing', 'b14-oil-and-gas-services', 'b43-pulp-and-paper-products']"
Cross-Industry Comparison,Which of the following metrics is UNIQUELY important to the Pulp & Paper Products industry compared to the Oil & Gas - Services and Coal Operations industries?,Total water withdrawn,Percentage of operations in water-stressed areas,Amount of recycled and recovered fiber procured,Gross global Scope 1 emissions,Energy consumption from renewable sources,C. Amount of recycled and recovered fiber procured,"The amount of recycled and recovered fiber procured (RR-PP-430a.2) is a metric uniquely important to the Pulp & Paper Products industry. This metric reflects the industry's focus on circular economy principles and sustainable resource use, which is not directly applicable to the Oil & Gas - Services or Coal Operations industries.","These industries involve significant extraction and processing of natural resources. Comparing their sustainability practices is insightful to address environmental degradation, resource efficiency, and social impacts on local communities.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Pulp & Paper Products', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Services', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Coal Operations']","['468-470', '124-125', '43-44']","['b7-coal-operations', 'b10-metals-and-mining', 'b11-oil-and-gas-exploration-and-production', 'b13-oil-and-gas-refining-and-marketing', 'b14-oil-and-gas-services', 'b43-pulp-and-paper-products']"
