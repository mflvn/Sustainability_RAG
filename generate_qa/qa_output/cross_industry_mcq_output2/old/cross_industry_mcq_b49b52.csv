Reporting Requirements,"When disclosing renewable energy consumption, what specific requirement is common to both the Electrical & Electronic Equipment and Hotels & Lodging industries according to IFRS standards?",Renewable energy must be sourced locally,Only solar and wind energy can be considered renewable,Renewable energy certificates (RECs) must be retained and retired for on-site generation,Hydroelectric power is excluded from renewable energy calculations,Renewable energy must constitute at least 10% of total energy consumption,C. Renewable energy certificates (RECs) must be retained and retired for on-site generation,"Both industries have the same requirement for renewable energy disclosure: 'For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy.' This ensures that companies accurately report their renewable energy usage without double-counting.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Electrical & Electronic Equipment', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Hotels & Lodging']","['524', '540']",Energy consumption and efficiency are key sustainability issues in both the manufacture of electrical equipment and the operation of hotels.,"['b49-electrical-and-electronic-equipment', 'b52-hotels-and-lodging']"
Metric Selection and Calculation,"When calculating the percentage of renewable energy consumed, what is a key difference in the scope of biomass sources between the Electrical & Electronic Equipment and Hotels & Lodging industries?",Hotels & Lodging excludes all biomass sources,Electrical & Electronic Equipment includes only forest-certified biomass,Hotels & Lodging includes all types of biomass without restrictions,Electrical & Electronic Equipment has no restrictions on biomass sources,There is no difference in the scope of biomass sources between the two industries,E. There is no difference in the scope of biomass sources between the two industries,"Both industries have identical requirements for the scope of renewable energy from biomass sources. They both limit it to materials certified to third-party standards, materials considered eligible according to the Green-e Framework, and/or materials eligible for applicable state renewable portfolio standards. This consistency ensures comparability across different industries in sustainability reporting.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Electrical & Electronic Equipment', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Hotels & Lodging']","['524', '540']",Energy consumption and efficiency are key sustainability issues in both the manufacture of electrical equipment and the operation of hotels.,"['b49-electrical-and-electronic-equipment', 'b52-hotels-and-lodging']"
Metric Selection and Calculation,"In the context of energy management reporting, what calculation is required for both the Electrical & Electronic Equipment and Hotels & Lodging industries, but might yield significantly different results due to the nature of their operations?",Percentage of energy from nuclear sources,Percentage of grid electricity used,Total energy produced on-site,Energy intensity per square foot,Percentage of energy used in manufacturing processes,B. Percentage of grid electricity used,"Both industries are required to calculate and disclose the percentage of energy consumed that was supplied from grid electricity. However, the results would likely differ significantly. Electrical & Electronic Equipment companies might have a lower percentage due to more on-site energy generation or diverse energy sources for manufacturing, while Hotels & Lodging businesses typically rely heavily on grid electricity for their operations, potentially resulting in a higher percentage.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Electrical & Electronic Equipment', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Hotels & Lodging']","['523', '539']",Energy consumption and efficiency are key sustainability issues in both the manufacture of electrical equipment and the operation of hotels.,"['b49-electrical-and-electronic-equipment', 'b52-hotels-and-lodging']"
Cross-Industry Comparison,How does the focus on product-related energy efficiency differ between the Electrical & Electronic Equipment and Hotels & Lodging industries in their IFRS sustainability reporting requirements?,Only Hotels & Lodging reports on product energy efficiency,Both industries have identical product energy efficiency metrics,"Electrical & Electronic Equipment reports on product energy efficiency, while Hotels & Lodging focuses on facility efficiency",Neither industry reports on product energy efficiency,"Both industries report on energy efficiency, but only for their manufacturing processes","C. Electrical & Electronic Equipment reports on product energy efficiency, while Hotels & Lodging focuses on facility efficiency","The Electrical & Electronic Equipment industry has specific metrics related to product energy efficiency, such as 'Percentage of eligible products, by revenue, that meet ENERGY STARÂ® criteria' (RT-EE-410a.2) and 'Revenue from renewable energy-related and energy efficiency-related products' (RT-EE-410a.3). In contrast, the Hotels & Lodging industry focuses on the energy efficiency of its facilities, as seen in the energy management metric (SV-HL-130a.1) which relates to total energy consumed by the facilities rather than products.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Electrical & Electronic Equipment', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Hotels & Lodging']","['525-527', '539-540']",Energy consumption and efficiency are key sustainability issues in both the manufacture of electrical equipment and the operation of hotels.,"['b49-electrical-and-electronic-equipment', 'b52-hotels-and-lodging']"
