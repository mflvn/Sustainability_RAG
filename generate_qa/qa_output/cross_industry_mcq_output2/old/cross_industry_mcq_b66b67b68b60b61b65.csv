Metric Selection and Calculation,"When calculating and reporting on fuel consumption for the Air Freight & Logistics, Airlines, Cruise Lines, Marine Transportation, Rail Transportation, and Road Transportation industries, which of the following is the correct unit of measurement and calculation approach according to IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures?","Liters (L), based on fuel purchases only","Metric tons (t), based on design parameters","Gigajoules (GJ), based on actual fuel consumed","Gallons (gal), based on fuel expenses only","Barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), based on industry averages","C. Gigajoules (GJ), based on actual fuel consumed","According to the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures for all mentioned transportation industries, fuel consumption should be reported in gigajoules (GJ) and calculated based on actual fuel consumed. The standard specifically states that the calculation methodology for fuel consumed shall be based on actual fuel consumed as opposed to design parameters. Acceptable calculation methodologies include those based on adding fuel purchases to beginning inventory less ending inventory, tracking fuel consumed by vehicles, or tracking fuel expenses. The use of gigajoules as the unit of measurement allows for consistent comparison across different fuel types and transportation modes.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Air Freight & Logistics', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Airlines', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Cruise Lines', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Marine Transportation', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Rail Transportation', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Road Transportation']","['594', '603', '628', '634', '639']","These industries are integral to global logistics and transportation.

Metric Selection and Calculation,"When reporting on renewable fuel consumption for the Air Freight & Logistics, Airlines, Marine Transportation, Rail Transportation, and Road Transportation industries, which of the following is NOT a criterion for defining renewable fuel according to IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures?",Produced from renewable biomass,Used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel in transportation fuel,Achieved net greenhouse gas emissions reduction on a lifecycle basis,Derived from sources that are replenished within a human lifespan,Meets the standard or regulation used by the entity to determine if a fuel is renewable,D. Derived from sources that are replenished within a human lifespan,"According to the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures for the mentioned transportation industries, renewable fuel is generally defined as fuel that meets the following criteria: produced from renewable biomass, used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel in transportation fuel, and achieved net greenhouse gas emissions reduction on a lifecycle basis. Additionally, entities are required to disclose the standard or regulation used to determine if a fuel is renewable. The criterion 'derived from sources that are replenished within a human lifespan' is not explicitly mentioned in the IFRS S2 definitions for these industries and is therefore not a required criterion for defining renewable fuel in sustainability reporting.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Air Freight & Logistics', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Airlines', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Marine Transportation', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Rail Transportation', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Road Transportation']","['594-595', '628-629', '634-635', '640']","These industries are integral to global logistics and transportation.

Average Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for new ships,"According to the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures, the Average Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for new ships is a metric uniquely required for the Cruise Lines industry. This metric is also required for the Marine Transportation industry but not for the other transportation industries mentioned. The EEDI is a measure of a ship's energy efficiency, expressed in grams of CO2 per ton-nautical mile. It is specific to maritime vessels and is not applicable to air or land-based transportation modes. While all the mentioned industries are required to report on total fuel consumed, Scope 1 emissions, and strategies to manage emissions, the EEDI is a specialized metric for the maritime sector, reflecting the unique challenges and opportunities for energy efficiency in ship design and operation.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Air Freight & Logistics', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Airlines', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Cruise Lines', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Marine Transportation', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Rail Transportation', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Road Transportation']","['617', '623', '629']","These industries are integral to global logistics and transportation.
