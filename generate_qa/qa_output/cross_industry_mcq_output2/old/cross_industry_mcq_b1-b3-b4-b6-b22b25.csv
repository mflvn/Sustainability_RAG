Reporting Requirements,"When preparing sustainability reports for the E-Commerce, Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors, and Food Retailers & Distributors industries, which of the following is a unique reporting requirement for the Food Retailers & Distributors industry?",Disclosure of total energy consumed,Reporting on percentage of grid electricity used,Disclosure of gross global Scope 1 emissions from refrigerants,Reporting on renewable energy percentage,Disclosure of data processing capacity,C: Disclosure of gross global Scope 1 emissions from refrigerants,"While all three industries have requirements related to energy consumption, only the Food Retailers & Distributors industry has a specific requirement (FB-FR-110b.1) to disclose gross global Scope 1 emissions from refrigerants. This is due to the significant use of refrigeration in food retail, which is not as prominent in the other two industries.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: E-Commerce', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Multiline and Specialty Retailers & Distributors', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Food Retailers & Distributors']","['27', '40', '218']","These industries involve extensive supply chain management, global sourcing, and retail operations.

Metric Selection and Calculation,"When calculating the percentage of sustainably sourced materials for the Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry and the Processed Foods industry, what is a key difference in the metric calculation?","Apparel uses weight, while Processed Foods uses cost","Apparel includes all materials, while Processed Foods only includes organic ingredients","Processed Foods considers Tier 2 suppliers, while Apparel only looks at Tier 1","Apparel uses revenue, while Processed Foods uses volume","Processed Foods excludes water, while Apparel includes all inputs","A: Apparel uses weight, while Processed Foods uses cost","The key difference is in the calculation method. For the Apparel industry, the metric CG-AA-440a.2 calculates the percentage based on the weight of raw materials. In contrast, the Processed Foods industry metric FB-PF-430a.1 uses the cost of food ingredients purchased from Tier 1 suppliers. This difference reflects the distinct nature of inputs in each industry and affects how companies must track and report their sustainably sourced materials.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Apparel, Accessories & Footwear', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Processed Foods']","['10', '265']","These industries involve extensive supply chain management, global sourcing, and retail operations.

Metric Selection and Calculation,"When reporting on water management for the Building Products & Furnishings industry and the Processed Foods industry, which of the following represents a key difference in the required metrics?",Only Processed Foods reports on water consumption,"Building Products reports on water quality, while Processed Foods does not","Processed Foods must disclose water-related non-compliance incidents, while Building Products does not","Building Products reports on water recycling rates, while Processed Foods does not",Only Building Products reports on water withdrawn in water-stressed regions,"C: Processed Foods must disclose water-related non-compliance incidents, while Building Products does not","A key difference in water management reporting between these industries is that the Processed Foods industry has a specific metric (FB-PF-140a.2) requiring disclosure of the number of incidents of non-compliance associated with water quantity and/or quality permits, standards, and regulations. The Building Products & Furnishings industry does not have a similar requirement for reporting water-related non-compliance incidents. This reflects the higher regulatory scrutiny on water usage and quality in food processing operations.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Building Products & Furnishings', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Processed Foods']","['19', '262']","These industries involve extensive supply chain management, global sourcing, and retail operations.
