    "question": "When reporting on energy management, which of the following is a key difference between the requirements for Health Care Delivery companies and Drug Retailers?",
    "optionA": "Only Health Care Delivery companies need to report total energy consumed",
    "optionB": "Drug Retailers must report energy consumption for each individual store",
    "optionC": "Health Care Delivery companies must report on waste management, while Drug Retailers do not",
    "optionD": "Drug Retailers are not required to report the percentage of renewable energy consumed",
    "optionE": "Health Care Delivery companies must report energy consumption by source type",
    "answer": "C: Health Care Delivery companies must report on waste management, while Drug Retailers do not",
    "explanation": "While both industries are required to report on total energy consumed, percentage of grid electricity, and percentage of renewable energy, Health Care Delivery companies have additional requirements to report on waste management, including medical and pharmaceutical waste. Drug Retailers do not have specific waste management reporting requirements in their industry standard.",
