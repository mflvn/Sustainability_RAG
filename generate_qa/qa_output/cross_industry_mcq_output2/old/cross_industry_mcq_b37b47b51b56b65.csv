1,"When reporting on energy consumption, what key difference exists between the disclosure requirements for Cruise Lines and Internet Media & Services companies?","Cruise Lines must report percentage of heavy fuel oil, while Internet Media & Services do not","Internet Media & Services must report data processing capacity, while Cruise Lines do not","Cruise Lines must report renewable energy percentage, while Internet Media & Services do not","Internet Media & Services must report water consumption, while Cruise Lines do not",There are no significant differences in energy reporting requirements between these industries,"A: Cruise Lines must report percentage of heavy fuel oil, while Internet Media & Services do not","Cruise Lines are required to disclose the percentage of energy consumed from heavy fuel oil (TR-CL-110a.3), which is specific to their industry due to the use of marine fuels. Internet Media & Services companies do not have this requirement, as their energy consumption is primarily related to data centers and does not typically involve heavy fuel oil.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Cruise Lines', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Internet Media & Services']","['619', '560-561']","These industries vary widely in their sustainability challenges and opportunities, from resource use and environmental impact to social responsibility and governance.

1,What unique disclosure requirement do Internet Media & Services companies have regarding environmental considerations that is not applicable to Cruise Lines?,Disclosure of carbon offset purchases,Reporting on e-waste management,Discussion of environmental considerations in data center planning,Disclosure of renewable energy certificates,Reporting on biodiversity impact,C: Discussion of environmental considerations in data center planning,Internet Media & Services companies are required to discuss the integration of environmental considerations into strategic planning for data center needs (TC-IM-130a.3). This is specific to their industry due to the significant environmental impact of data centers. Cruise Lines do not have a comparable requirement as they do not operate data centers as a core part of their business.,['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Internet Media & Services'],['563'],"These industries vary widely in their sustainability challenges and opportunities, from resource use and environmental impact to social responsibility and governance.

2,"When calculating the percentage of renewable energy consumed, what specific consideration is common to both Cruise Lines and Internet Media & Services industries?",Inclusion of nuclear energy as renewable,Exclusion of hydroelectric power,Requirement to use only on-site generated renewable energy,Inclusion of renewable energy certificates (RECs) from explicit agreements,Consideration of tidal energy as a primary renewable source,D: Inclusion of renewable energy certificates (RECs) from explicit agreements,"Both industries share the same consideration for renewable energy calculation: they can include renewable energy purchased through agreements that explicitly include renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs). This is specified in TR-CL-110a.3 for Cruise Lines and TC-IM-130a.1 for Internet Media & Services. Both require that for PPAs and green power products, the agreement must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Cruise Lines', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Internet Media & Services']","['621-622', '560-561']","These industries vary widely in their sustainability challenges and opportunities, from resource use and environmental impact to social responsibility and governance.

2,What metric is unique to the Cruise Lines industry for measuring energy efficiency that doesn't apply to Internet Media & Services?,Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE),Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI),Carbon Intensity Index (CII),Data Center Efficiency (DCE),Fuel Efficiency Ratio (FER),B: Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI),"The Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) is a unique metric for the Cruise Lines industry (TR-CL-110a.4). It measures the energy efficiency of new ships in grams of carbon dioxide per ton-nautical mile. This metric is specific to the maritime industry and is not applicable to Internet Media & Services companies, which focus more on data center efficiency metrics.",['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Cruise Lines'],['622'],"These industries vary widely in their sustainability challenges and opportunities, from resource use and environmental impact to social responsibility and governance.

3,How does the focus of water-related sustainability reporting differ between the Cruise Lines and Internet Media & Services industries?,Only Cruise Lines report on water consumption,"Internet Media & Services focus on water quality, while Cruise Lines focus on quantity","Cruise Lines report on marine water use, while Internet Media & Services report on freshwater consumption","Internet Media & Services report on water stress, while Cruise Lines do not address water issues",Both industries have identical water reporting requirements,"C: Cruise Lines report on marine water use, while Internet Media & Services report on freshwater consumption","The focus of water-related sustainability reporting differs significantly between these industries. Cruise Lines, operating in marine environments, do not have specific water consumption metrics in their disclosure requirements. In contrast, Internet Media & Services companies are required to report on total water withdrawn and consumed, with a focus on regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress (TC-IM-130a.2). This difference reflects the distinct operational environments and impacts of each industry.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Cruise Lines', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Internet Media & Services']","['618-622', '562-563']","These industries vary widely in their sustainability challenges and opportunities, from resource use and environmental impact to social responsibility and governance.

3,"In terms of greenhouse gas emissions reporting, what key difference exists between the Cruise Lines and Internet Media & Services industries?",Only Cruise Lines report Scope 1 emissions,"Internet Media & Services report Scope 2 emissions, while Cruise Lines do not","Cruise Lines must discuss emission reduction targets, while Internet Media & Services do not","Internet Media & Services report on carbon offsets, while Cruise Lines do not",There are no significant differences in GHG emissions reporting between these industries,"C: Cruise Lines must discuss emission reduction targets, while Internet Media & Services do not","A key difference in greenhouse gas emissions reporting is that Cruise Lines are explicitly required to discuss their long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, including emission reduction targets and an analysis of performance against those targets (TR-CL-110a.2). The Internet Media & Services industry standards do not include a similar requirement for discussing emission reduction targets. This reflects the more direct and significant impact of Cruise Lines' operations on GHG emissions compared to Internet Media & Services companies.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Cruise Lines', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Internet Media & Services']","['619-620', '559-563']","These industries vary widely in their sustainability challenges and opportunities, from resource use and environmental impact to social responsibility and governance.
