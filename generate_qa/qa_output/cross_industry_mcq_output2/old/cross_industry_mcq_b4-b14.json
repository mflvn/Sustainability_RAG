    "explanation": "E-Commerce companies are required to disclose a discussion of the integration of environmental considerations into strategic planning for data center needs (CG-EC-130a.3). This is specific to the E-Commerce industry due to its reliance on data centers. Oil & Gas Services companies do not have a similar requirement related to data centers in their industry-specific disclosures.",

    "explanation": "Both industries consider renewable energy directly produced on-site as part of their renewable energy calculation, provided that any associated RECs are retained and not sold. This is explicitly stated for E-Commerce (CG-EC-130a.1) and would also apply to Oil & Gas Services (EM-SV-110a.1) when calculating their renewable energy percentage.",

    "answer": "B: Oil & Gas Services includes flowback water, while E-Commerce does not",
    "explanation": "A key difference in water-related metrics between these industries is that Oil & Gas Services specifically includes flowback water in its water recycling calculations (EM-SV-140a.1). This is unique to the oil and gas industry and is not relevant for E-Commerce water metrics, which focus more on data center and general operational water use (CG-EC-130a.2).",

E-Commerce companies must account for fuel used in product delivery and transportation (CG-EC-410a.1, CG-EC-410a.2), while Oil & Gas Services companies need to report on fuel used in their operations, including on-road and off-road equipment (EM-SV-110a.1).
