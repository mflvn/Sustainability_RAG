Cross-Industry Comparison,How do the IFRS sustainability reporting requirements for supply chain environmental and social impacts differ between the Household & Personal Products and Processed Foods industries?,Only Household & Personal Products must report on certified sustainable sourcing,Only Processed Foods must report on supplier audit non-conformance rates,"Household & Personal Products focus on palm oil, while Processed Foods cover all food ingredients",Processed Foods have no requirements for supplier environmental audits,Both industries have identical supply chain reporting requirements,"C: Household & Personal Products focus on palm oil, while Processed Foods cover all food ingredients","The IFRS standards show a key difference in supply chain reporting between these industries. The Household & Personal Products industry has specific requirements for reporting on palm oil sourcing and RSPO certification (CG-HP-430a.1). In contrast, the Processed Foods industry has broader requirements covering all food ingredients, including the percentage certified to third-party environmental and/or social standards (FB-PF-430a.1) and supplier audit results (FB-PF-430a.2). This reflects the different supply chain priorities and impacts of each industry.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Household & Personal Products', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Processed Foods']","['38', '265-267']","Household and personal products, like processed foods, involve complex supply chains, with sustainability metrics focused on waste, resource use, and packaging.","['b5-household-and-personal-products', 'b25-processed-foods']"
Cross-Industry Comparison,"When comparing water management disclosures for the Household & Personal Products and Processed Foods industries under IFRS standards, which of the following is a key difference?",Only Processed Foods must describe water management risks and strategies,Household & Personal Products are not required to report water consumption,Processed Foods must report incidents of non-compliance with water regulations,Only Household & Personal Products use the WRI Aqueduct tool for water stress assessment,Processed Foods do not need to disclose water withdrawn in high stress areas,C: Processed Foods must report incidents of non-compliance with water regulations,"A key difference in water management disclosures between these industries is that the Processed Foods industry is specifically required to report the 'Number of incidents of non-compliance associated with water quantity and/or quality permits, standards, and regulations' (FB-PF-140a.2). This requirement is not present for the Household & Personal Products industry. Both industries share similar requirements for reporting total water withdrawn and consumed, percentages in water-stressed areas, and descriptions of water management risks and strategies. This additional metric for Processed Foods reflects the industry's particular regulatory risks related to water use and discharge in food processing operations.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Household & Personal Products', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Processed Foods']","['34-37', '261-264']","Household and personal products, like processed foods, involve complex supply chains, with sustainability metrics focused on waste, resource use, and packaging.","['b5-household-and-personal-products', 'b25-processed-foods']"
