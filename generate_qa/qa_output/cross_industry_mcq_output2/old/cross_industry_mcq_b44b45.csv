Reporting Requirements,"When reporting on energy consumption for the Solar Technology & Project Developers industry, which of the following is NOT required to be disclosed according to IFRS S2?",Total energy consumed,Percentage of grid electricity,Percentage of renewable energy,Energy intensity per unit of production,Conversion factors used for calculations,D. Energy intensity per unit of production,"According to the IFRS S2 requirements for the Solar Technology & Project Developers industry, companies must disclose total energy consumed, percentage of grid electricity, and percentage of renewable energy. Energy intensity per unit of production is not specifically required. The standard also mentions that entities should apply conversion factors consistently for all reported data.",['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Solar Technology & Project Developers'],"['473', '474', '475']","Both industries are central to the renewable energy sector and share sustainability themes related to lifecycle analysis, resource use, and environmental impact.","['b44-solar-technology-and-project-developers', 'b45-wind-technology-and-project-developers']"
Reporting Requirements,"In contrast to the Solar Technology industry, what unique material-related disclosure is required for the Wind Technology & Project Developers industry?",Total water withdrawn and consumed,Greenhouse gas emissions,Top five materials consumed by weight,Percentage of recycled materials used,Energy consumption in manufacturing,C. Top five materials consumed by weight,"The Wind Technology & Project Developers industry has a specific requirement to disclose the top five materials consumed by weight (RR-WT-440b.1). This is unique compared to the Solar Technology industry, which focuses more on energy and water consumption in its specific disclosures.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Wind Technology & Project Developers', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Solar Technology & Project Developers']","['484', '485']","Both industries are central to the renewable energy sector and share sustainability themes related to lifecycle analysis, resource use, and environmental impact.","['b44-solar-technology-and-project-developers', 'b45-wind-technology-and-project-developers']"
Metric Selection and Calculation,"When calculating the percentage of renewable energy consumed for the Solar Technology industry, which of the following sources should NOT be included?",Renewable fuel consumed by the entity,Renewable energy directly produced by the entity,Renewable energy purchased through a PPA with explicit RECs,Grid electricity from renewable sources outside the entity's control,Renewable energy with Green-e Energy Certified RECs,D. Grid electricity from renewable sources outside the entity's control,"According to the IFRS S2 requirements for the Solar Technology industry, the renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of renewable energy calculation. All other options listed are valid sources to be included in the calculation.",['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Solar Technology & Project Developers'],"['474', '475']","Both industries are central to the renewable energy sector and share sustainability themes related to lifecycle analysis, resource use, and environmental impact.","['b44-solar-technology-and-project-developers', 'b45-wind-technology-and-project-developers']"
Metric Selection and Calculation,"In the Wind Technology & Project Developers industry, how is the 'average top head mass per turbine capacity' metric calculated?",Total weight of all turbines divided by total capacity,Weight of nacelle and rotor divided by turbine capacity in MW,"Weight of nacelle, rotor, and blades divided by turbine capacity in MW",Weight of entire turbine including tower divided by capacity,Weight of nacelle divided by turbine capacity in MW,B. Weight of nacelle and rotor divided by turbine capacity in MW,"According to RR-WT-440b.2, the average top head mass per turbine capacity is calculated as the mass of the top head (which includes the turbine nacelle and the turbine rotor, but excludes the blades) in metric tons divided by turbine capacity in megawatts (MW).",['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Wind Technology & Project Developers'],['485'],"Both industries are central to the renewable energy sector and share sustainability themes related to lifecycle analysis, resource use, and environmental impact.","['b44-solar-technology-and-project-developers', 'b45-wind-technology-and-project-developers']"
Cross-Industry Comparison,How do the IFRS S2 water management disclosure requirements differ between the Solar Technology and Wind Technology industries?,Only Solar Technology has specific water management disclosures,Only Wind Technology has specific water management disclosures,Both industries have identical water management disclosures,"Wind Technology focuses on freshwater use, while Solar Technology includes all water sources","Solar Technology requires water stress analysis, while Wind Technology does not",A. Only Solar Technology has specific water management disclosures,"The IFRS S2 requirements for the Solar Technology industry include specific water management disclosures (RR-ST-140a.1 and RR-ST-140a.2), covering total water withdrawn, consumed, and water stress analysis. In contrast, the Wind Technology industry requirements do not include specific water management disclosures, focusing instead on materials efficiency.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Solar Technology & Project Developers', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Wind Technology & Project Developers']","['475', '476', '477', '478', '483', '484', '485', '486']","Both industries are central to the renewable energy sector and share sustainability themes related to lifecycle analysis, resource use, and environmental impact.","['b44-solar-technology-and-project-developers', 'b45-wind-technology-and-project-developers']"
Cross-Industry Comparison,Which sustainability theme is emphasized in the Wind Technology industry disclosures but not explicitly required in the Solar Technology industry disclosures?,Energy management,Water management,Materials efficiency,Greenhouse gas emissions,Waste management,C. Materials efficiency,"The Wind Technology & Project Developers industry has specific disclosures focused on materials efficiency (RR-WT-440b.1, RR-WT-440b.2, RR-WT-440b.3), including top materials consumed, average top head mass per turbine capacity, and approach to optimize materials efficiency. The Solar Technology industry disclosures do not explicitly require reporting on materials efficiency, focusing instead on energy management, water management, and integration with existing energy infrastructure.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Solar Technology & Project Developers', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Wind Technology & Project Developers']","['471', '472', '473', '474', '475', '476', '477', '478', '479', '480', '481', '482', '483', '484', '485', '486']","Both industries are central to the renewable energy sector and share sustainability themes related to lifecycle analysis, resource use, and environmental impact.","['b44-solar-technology-and-project-developers', 'b45-wind-technology-and-project-developers']"
