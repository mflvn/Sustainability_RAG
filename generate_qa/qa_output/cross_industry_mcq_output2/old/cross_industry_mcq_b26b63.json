    "question": "When calculating and reporting fuel economy metrics, what is a key difference between the restaurant and automobile industries?",
    "optionA": "Restaurants report fuel economy in miles per gallon, while automobile manufacturers use liters per kilometer",
    "optionB": "Automobile manufacturers report sales-weighted average fleet fuel economy, while restaurants do not report fuel economy",
    "optionC": "Restaurants calculate fuel economy based on delivery vehicles, while automobile manufacturers focus on passenger vehicles",
    "optionD": "Automobile manufacturers report fuel economy by vehicle type, while restaurants report it by kitchen appliance",
    "optionE": "Restaurants report fuel economy improvements annually, while automobile manufacturers report it by model year",
    "answer": "B: Automobile manufacturers report sales-weighted average fleet fuel economy, while restaurants do not report fuel economy",
    "explanation": "Automobile manufacturers are required to report sales-weighted average passenger fleet fuel economy (TR-AU-410a.1), which is a crucial metric for their industry. Restaurants, on the other hand, do not have specific fuel economy reporting requirements in their IFRS standards, as their operations typically don't involve a fleet of vehicles.",

    "answer": "E: Total energy consumed from all sources in gigajoules (GJ)",
    "explanation": "Both industries are required to report total energy consumed from all sources in gigajoules (GJ). This is explicitly stated for restaurants (FB-RN-130a.1) and is a standard sustainability reporting metric that would also apply to automobile manufacturers. This common metric allows for comparison of energy consumption across different industries and company sizes.",

    "optionE": "Neither industry is required to report on product lifecycle emissions",
    "answer": "A: Restaurants focus on sourcing emissions, while automobile manufacturers focus on use-phase emissions",
    "explanation": "The IFRS standards for restaurants emphasize reporting on supply chain management and food sourcing (FB-RN-430a.1, FB-RN-430a.2, FB-RN-430a.3), which relates to sourcing emissions. For automobile manufacturers, there's a strong focus on use-phase emissions through fuel economy and emissions metrics (TR-AU-410a.1, TR-AU-410a.2, TR-AU-410a.3). This difference reflects the distinct environmental impacts and challenges of each industry.",

For automobile manufacturers, energy management is implicit in the focus on fuel economy and emissions (TR-AU-410a.1, TR-AU-410a.2, TR-AU-410a.3). Both industries are required to report on their energy consumption and strategies to improve energy efficiency, reflecting the importance of energy management in sustainability efforts across different sectors.",
