Metric Selection and Calculation,"When calculating the percentage of raw materials certified to sustainability standards in the Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry and the percentage of wood fiber materials certified to standards in the Building Products & Furnishings industry, what is a key difference in the calculation method?","Apparel uses revenue, while Building Products uses weight","Apparel uses weight, while Building Products uses volume","Apparel uses units, while Building Products uses weight",Both use the same calculation method based on weight,"Apparel uses volume, while Building Products uses revenue",D. Both use the same calculation method based on weight,"Both industries use weight as the basis for calculating the percentage of materials certified to sustainability standards. For Apparel, Accessories & Footwear, the calculation is based on the weight of raw materials. For Building Products & Furnishings, the calculation is based on the weight of wood fiber materials in air-dried metric tons. This similarity reflects the importance of standardized measurement across industries for comparable sustainability reporting.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Apparel, Accessories & Footwear', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Building Products & Furnishings']","['9', '10', '22', '23']","These industries all involve consumer goods that have significant global supply chains, environmental impacts from manufacturing, and considerations around labor practices in emerging markets.","['b1-apparel-accessories-and-footwear', 'b2-appliance-manufacturing', 'b3-building-products-and-furnishings']"
