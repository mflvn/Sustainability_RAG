    "optionA": "Both industries are required to disclose the number of vehicles in their fleet",
    "optionB": "Only the Car Rental & Leasing industry is required to disclose fleet utilization rate",
    "optionC": "Both industries must report on fuel economy, but using different metrics",
    "optionD": "Health Care Distributors are required to disclose the number of rental days",
    "optionE": "Car Rental & Leasing companies must report on pharmaceutical units sold",
    "answer": "C: Both industries must report on fuel economy, but using different metrics",
    "explanation": "The Car Rental & Leasing industry is required to disclose 'Rental day-weighted average rental fleet fuel economy' (TR-CR-410a.1), while Health Care Distributors must report 'Payload fuel economy' (HC-DI-110a.1). Both metrics relate to fuel economy but are calculated differently based on the specific nature of each industry.",

    "qa_type": "Metric Selection and Calculation",
    "question": "When preparing sustainability reports, how do the fuel economy calculations differ between the Car Rental & Leasing and Health Care Distributors industries?",
    "optionA": "Car Rental uses a time-based weighting, while Health Care Distributors use a distance-based calculation",
    "optionB": "Health Care Distributors include vehicle weight in calculations, while Car Rental excludes it",
    "optionC": "Car Rental calculates per vehicle, while Health Care Distributors calculate for the entire fleet",
    "optionD": "Health Care Distributors use a payload-based calculation, while Car Rental uses a passenger-based calculation",
    "optionE": "Both industries use identical calculations based on total fuel consumed divided by total distance traveled",
    "answer": "D: Health Care Distributors use a payload-based calculation, while Car Rental uses a passenger-based calculation",
    "explanation": "Health Care Distributors calculate 'Payload fuel economy' as total gallons of fuel consumed divided by revenue ton miles (RTM), where RTM is based on the weight of paid tonnage transported. Car Rental & Leasing, on the other hand, calculates 'Rental day-weighted average rental fleet fuel economy' based on passenger vehicles, using metrics like mpg or gCO\u2082/km, which are passenger-oriented rather than payload-oriented.",
