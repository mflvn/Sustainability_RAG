    "qa_type": "Metric Selection and Calculation",
    "question": "When calculating the percentage of raw materials third-party certified to an environmental and/or social sustainability standard in the Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry, what is the correct denominator to use?",
    "optionA": "Total weight of all raw materials purchased",

    "optionE": "Total cost of raw materials",
    "answer": "C. Total weight of raw materials that compose the entity's finished products",
    "explanation": "According to the IFRS standards for the Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry, the percentage of certified raw materials should be calculated as the weight of raw materials third-party certified to an environmental and/or social standard divided by the total weight of raw materials that compose the entity's finished products. This ensures that the metric reflects the proportion of certified materials in the actual products, not just in purchases or priority materials.",

    "qa_type": "Metric Selection and Calculation",
    "question": "In the Industrial Machinery & Goods industry, how is the sales-weighted fuel efficiency for non-road equipment calculated according to IFRS standards?",
    "optionA": "Total fuel consumed divided by total hours of operation",
    "optionB": "Average of model-rated fuel efficiency values",
    "optionC": "Gallons of fuel consumed per 1,000 ton-miles",
    "optionD": "Gallons of fuel consumed per hour of operation, weighted by sales volume",
    "optionE": "Watts produced per gallon of fuel consumed",
    "answer": "D. Gallons of fuel consumed per hour of operation, weighted by sales volume",
    "explanation": "For the Industrial Machinery & Goods industry, IFRS standards require the calculation of sales-weighted fuel efficiency for non-road equipment as gallons of fuel consumed per hour of operation, weighted by the number of each unit sold during the reporting period. This metric provides a standardized way to compare fuel efficiency across different types of non-road equipment while accounting for sales volumes.",

    "optionA": "Only the Apparel industry requires reporting on supplier environmental practices",
    "optionB": "The Industrial Machinery industry focuses on Tier 1 suppliers, while Apparel considers multiple tiers",
    "optionC": "The Apparel industry requires disclosure of raw material sourcing risks, while Industrial Machinery does not",
    "optionD": "Industrial Machinery must report on supplier emissions, but Apparel does not",
    "optionE": "There are no significant differences in supply chain reporting requirements",
    "answer": "C. The Apparel industry requires disclosure of raw material sourcing risks, while Industrial Machinery does not",
    "explanation": "The Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry has specific requirements to disclose environmental and social risks associated with sourcing priority raw materials, including the description of these risks and the percentage of materials certified to sustainability standards. In contrast, the Industrial Machinery & Goods industry standards focus more on the energy efficiency and emissions of the products themselves, without explicit requirements for raw material sourcing risks. This difference reflects the unique supply chain challenges and sustainability focus areas of each industry.",

    "optionA": "Percentage of recycled materials used in products",
    "optionB": "Water consumption during manufacturing",

    "optionD": "Energy efficiency of production facilities",
    "optionE": "Percentage of products with eco-friendly packaging",
    "answer": "C. Sales-weighted emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM)",
    "explanation": "The sales-weighted emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) is a key metric for the Industrial Machinery & Goods industry, particularly for engines and heavy equipment. This metric is crucial for assessing the environmental impact during the use phase of these products. In contrast, the Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry typically doesn't have significant NOx or PM emissions during product use, making this metric less relevant. This difference highlights the distinct environmental considerations between machinery manufacturing and apparel production.",
