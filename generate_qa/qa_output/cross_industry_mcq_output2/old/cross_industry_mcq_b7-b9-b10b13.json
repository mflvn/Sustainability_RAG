    "optionB": "Calculation using 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values",

    "optionE": "Breakdown of emissions by individual facility locations",
    "answer": "E. Breakdown of emissions by individual facility locations",
    "explanation": "While both Coal Operations (EM-CO-110a.1) and Iron & Steel Producers (EM-IS-110a.1) are required to disclose gross global Scope 1 emissions, including all seven Kyoto Protocol GHGs, using 100-year GWP values, and the percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations, neither standard explicitly requires a breakdown of emissions by individual facility locations. This level of granularity is not mandated in the IFRS S2 requirements for these industries.",

The standards specifically state that the scope of emissions-limiting regulations excludes emissions covered under voluntary emissions-limiting regulations, such as voluntary trading systems. Emissions subject to mandatory schemes like EU ETS, California Cap-and-Trade, and Quebec Cap-and-Trade should be included, while ensuring not to double-count emissions subject to multiple regulations.",

    "explanation": "For both Metals & Mining (EM-MM-130a.1) and Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing (EM-RM-130a.1) industries, when calculating the percentage of renewable energy consumed, the standards require that for any renewable electricity generated on-site, the associated RECs must be retained (not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity to claim it as renewable energy. This ensures that the renewable attributes are not double-counted and accurately reflect the entity's renewable energy consumption.",

    "answer": "C. Coal Operations must report the number of incidents of non-compliance with water quality permits, while Iron & Steel Producers do not",
    "explanation": "The main difference in water management disclosure requirements between Coal Operations and Iron & Steel Producers is that Coal Operations (EM-CO-140a.2) must report the number of incidents of non-compliance associated with water quality permits, standards, and regulations. This metric is not included in the Iron & Steel Producers' water management disclosures. Both industries are required to report total fresh water withdrawn, percentage recycled, and percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress, but the additional compliance metric for Coal Operations reflects the industry-specific water quality concerns associated with coal mining and processing.",

    "answer": "B. Metals & Mining must report production of finished metal products, while Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing reports refining throughput",
    "explanation": "When comparing the activity metrics for Metals & Mining and Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing industries, a key difference is in their production reporting. Metals & Mining (EM-MM-000.A) is required to report the production of metal ores and finished metal products in metric tons. In contrast, Oil & Gas - Refining & Marketing (EM-RM-000.A) must report the refining throughput of crude oil and other feedstocks in barrels of oil equivalent (BOE). This difference reflects the distinct nature of their production processes and outputs, highlighting the industry-specific focus of IFRS S2 requirements.",
