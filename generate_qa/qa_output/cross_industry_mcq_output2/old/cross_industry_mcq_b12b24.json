    "explanation": "Both industries are required to disclose the percentage of their Scope 1 emissions that are covered under emissions-limiting regulations. For Oil & Gas - Midstream, this is explicitly stated in EM-MD-110a.1. For Non-Alcoholic Beverages, while not directly stated, it's implied in the general Scope 1 emissions reporting requirements (FB-NB-110a.1) which follow similar IFRS guidelines.",

    "explanation": "For the Oil & Gas - Midstream industry, the metric EM-MD-110a.1 specifically focuses on fleet fuel consumption and the percentage of renewable fuel. In contrast, for the Non-Alcoholic Beverages industry, the energy management metric FB-NB-130a.1 explicitly excludes fleet vehicles from the calculation of operational energy consumed and the percentage of renewable energy. This represents a key difference in how these industries calculate and report their renewable energy usage.",

This metric is not explicitly mentioned in the Oil & Gas - Midstream industry requirements. While both industries need to address water management, the Non-Alcoholic Beverages industry has more detailed requirements regarding water consumption in water-stressed regions, likely due to the critical nature of water as an input in beverage production.",

    "explanation": "The Non-Alcoholic Beverages industry has specific metrics (FB-NB-430a.1 and FB-NB-440a.2) that require reporting on suppliers' social and environmental responsibility audits and sourcing risks due to environmental and social considerations. In contrast, the Oil & Gas - Midstream industry standards do not explicitly mention supply chain environmental and social impact reporting requirements.
