Reporting Requirements,"When comparing the E-Commerce and Oil & Gas Services industries, which of the following is a required disclosure for E-Commerce companies but NOT for Oil & Gas Services companies?",Total energy consumed,Percentage of renewable energy used,Total water withdrawn,Discussion of environmental considerations in data center planning,Greenhouse gas emissions from product shipments,D: Discussion of environmental considerations in data center planning,E-Commerce companies are required to disclose a discussion of the integration of environmental considerations into strategic planning for data center needs (CG-EC-130a.3). This is specific to the E-Commerce industry due to its reliance on data centers. Oil & Gas Services companies do not have a similar requirement related to data centers in their industry-specific disclosures.,"['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: E-Commerce', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Services']","['27', '28', '29', '30']","E-commerce distribution involves significant fuel usage, making a comparison with oil and gas service’s environmental and logistics sustainability useful.","['b4-e-commerce', 'b14-oil-and-gas-services']"
Reporting Requirements,Which of the following metrics is required to be disclosed by both E-Commerce and Oil & Gas Services companies according to IFRS industry-based disclosure requirements?,Total greenhouse gas footprint of product shipments,Number of active rig sites,Total fuel consumed,Data processing capacity,Number of shipments,C: Total fuel consumed,"Both E-Commerce (CG-EC-130a.1) and Oil & Gas Services (EM-SV-110a.1) industries are required to disclose total fuel consumed. For E-Commerce, it's part of the energy consumption disclosure, while for Oil & Gas Services, it's specifically mentioned in the fuel consumption metric.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: E-Commerce', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Services']","['27', '28', '126', '127']","E-commerce distribution involves significant fuel usage, making a comparison with oil and gas service’s environmental and logistics sustainability useful.","['b4-e-commerce', 'b14-oil-and-gas-services']"
Metric Selection and Calculation,"When calculating the percentage of renewable energy consumed, which of the following is considered within scope for both E-Commerce and Oil & Gas Services companies?",Grid electricity with renewable energy certificates (RECs),Energy from biomass sources without third-party certification,Renewable energy directly produced on-site with retained RECs,The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix outside the entity's control,Purchased steam from renewable sources,C: Renewable energy directly produced on-site with retained RECs,"Both industries consider renewable energy directly produced on-site as part of their renewable energy calculation, provided that any associated RECs are retained and not sold. This is explicitly stated for E-Commerce (CG-EC-130a.1) and would also apply to Oil & Gas Services (EM-SV-110a.1) when calculating their renewable energy percentage.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: E-Commerce', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Services']","['28', '126', '127']","E-commerce distribution involves significant fuel usage, making a comparison with oil and gas service’s environmental and logistics sustainability useful.","['b4-e-commerce', 'b14-oil-and-gas-services']"
Metric Selection and Calculation,"When comparing water-related metrics for E-Commerce and Oil & Gas Services industries, which of the following is a key difference in their respective calculations?","E-Commerce includes rainwater, while Oil & Gas Services does not","Oil & Gas Services includes flowback water, while E-Commerce does not","E-Commerce calculates water stress, while Oil & Gas Services does not","Oil & Gas Services only considers fresh water, while E-Commerce includes all water types","E-Commerce measures water in cubic meters, while Oil & Gas Services uses gallons","B: Oil & Gas Services includes flowback water, while E-Commerce does not","A key difference in water-related metrics between these industries is that Oil & Gas Services specifically includes flowback water in its water recycling calculations (EM-SV-140a.1). This is unique to the oil and gas industry and is not relevant for E-Commerce water metrics, which focus more on data center and general operational water use (CG-EC-130a.2).","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: E-Commerce', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Services']","['29', '130', '131']","E-commerce distribution involves significant fuel usage, making a comparison with oil and gas service’s environmental and logistics sustainability useful.","['b4-e-commerce', 'b14-oil-and-gas-services']"
Industry-Specific Challenges,Which of the following represents a unique sustainability reporting challenge for E-Commerce companies when compared to Oil & Gas Services companies?,Reporting on fuel efficiency of delivery vehicles,Disclosing water consumption in data centers,Calculating emissions from drilling operations,Reporting on workplace safety incidents,Disclosing the number of active well sites,B: Disclosing water consumption in data centers,"E-Commerce companies face a unique challenge in reporting water consumption in data centers (CG-EC-130a.2). This is specific to the E-Commerce industry due to its heavy reliance on data centers for operations. Oil & Gas Services companies do not have similar data center-related disclosure requirements, focusing instead on water management in drilling and fracturing operations (EM-SV-140a.1, EM-SV-140a.2).","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: E-Commerce', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Services']","['29', '130', '131']","E-commerce distribution involves significant fuel usage, making a comparison with oil and gas service’s environmental and logistics sustainability useful.","['b4-e-commerce', 'b14-oil-and-gas-services']"
Industry-Specific Challenges,"When preparing sustainability reports, which of the following areas presents a common challenge for both E-Commerce and Oil & Gas Services companies, but for different industry-specific reasons?",Reporting on biodiversity impacts,Disclosing scope 3 emissions,Calculating and reporting on fuel consumption,Assessing cybersecurity risks,Reporting on labor practices in the supply chain,C: Calculating and reporting on fuel consumption,"Both E-Commerce and Oil & Gas Services companies face challenges in calculating and reporting fuel consumption, but for different industry-specific reasons. E-Commerce companies must account for fuel used in product delivery and transportation (CG-EC-410a.1, CG-EC-410a.2), while Oil & Gas Services companies need to report on fuel used in their operations, including on-road and off-road equipment (EM-SV-110a.1). Both industries must also consider the percentage of renewable fuels used, adding complexity to their reporting.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: E-Commerce', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Services']","['31', '32', '126', '127']","E-commerce distribution involves significant fuel usage, making a comparison with oil and gas service’s environmental and logistics sustainability useful.","['b4-e-commerce', 'b14-oil-and-gas-services']"
