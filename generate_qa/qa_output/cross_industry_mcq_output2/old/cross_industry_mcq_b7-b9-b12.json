    "answer": "A. Iron & Steel Producers report on production volume, while Oil & Gas - Midstream report on transportation volume",
    "explanation": "A key difference in activity metrics between these industries is that Iron & Steel Producers are required to report on production volumes (e.g., raw steel production, EM-IS-000.A), while Oil & Gas - Midstream companies report on transportation volumes (total metric ton-kilometers of products transported, EM-MD-000.A).
