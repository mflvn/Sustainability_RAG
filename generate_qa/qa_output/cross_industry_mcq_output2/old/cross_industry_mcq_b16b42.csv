1,"When reporting on the incorporation of ESG factors in credit analysis, what is a key difference between the requirements for commercial banks and fuel cell manufacturers?","Commercial banks must disclose their approach, while fuel cell manufacturers do not","Fuel cell manufacturers must disclose their approach, while commercial banks do not","Both industries must disclose their approach, but using different metrics",Neither industry is required to disclose their approach to ESG incorporation,"Commercial banks must only disclose for project finance, while fuel cell manufacturers must disclose for all products","A. Commercial banks must disclose their approach, while fuel cell manufacturers do not","According to the IFRS standards, commercial banks are required to describe their approach to incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in credit analysis (metric FN-CB-410a.2). This requirement is specific to the commercial banking industry and is not present in the disclosure requirements for fuel cell manufacturers.",['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Metrics'],['146-149'],"Commercial banks finance the development of sustainable technologies like fuel cells; thus, their investment strategies affect sustainability.","['b16-commercial-banks', 'b42-fuel-cells-and-industrial-batteries']"
1,What is a key difference in the reporting requirements for transition risk exposure between commercial banks and fuel cell manufacturers?,Only commercial banks must report on financed emissions,Only fuel cell manufacturers must report on financed emissions,"Both industries must report on financed emissions, but using different metrics",Neither industry is required to report on financed emissions,"Commercial banks report on financed emissions, while fuel cell manufacturers report on product emissions",A. Only commercial banks must report on financed emissions,"According to the IFRS standards, commercial banks are required to disclose their financed emissions (metrics FN-CB-3 and FN-CB-4), which are emissions attributed to their loans and investments. This requirement is specific to the banking industry and is not present in the disclosure requirements for fuel cell manufacturers, who instead focus on product efficiency metrics.",['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Metrics'],"['151-154', '450-453']","Commercial banks finance the development of sustainable technologies like fuel cells; thus, their investment strategies affect sustainability.","['b16-commercial-banks', 'b42-fuel-cells-and-industrial-batteries']"
2,How does the calculation of energy efficiency differ between commercial banks' financed emissions and fuel cells' energy output?,"Banks use CO2-e per unit of currency, while fuel cells use electrical and thermal efficiency percentages","Banks use kWh per transaction, while fuel cells use watt-hours per kilogram",Both use the same metric of CO2-e per MWh,"Banks don't calculate energy efficiency, only total emissions","Fuel cells don't calculate energy efficiency, only storage capacity","A. Banks use CO2-e per unit of currency, while fuel cells use electrical and thermal efficiency percentages","Commercial banks calculate financed emissions intensity using metrics like CO2-e per unit of currency invested (FN-CB-4). Fuel cell manufacturers, on the other hand, measure energy efficiency as electrical efficiency (net electricity produced divided by total fuel energy input) and thermal efficiency (net useful power output divided by total fuel energy input), both expressed as percentages (RR-FC-410a.2).",['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Metrics'],"['152-153', '450-451']","Commercial banks finance the development of sustainable technologies like fuel cells; thus, their investment strategies affect sustainability.","['b16-commercial-banks', 'b42-fuel-cells-and-industrial-batteries']"
2,"When calculating and reporting on renewable energy usage, what is a key difference between commercial banks and fuel cell manufacturers?","Banks report on financed renewable projects, while fuel cell manufacturers report on their own energy consumption","Fuel cell manufacturers report on renewable energy production, while banks don't report on renewable energy",Both report on their operational renewable energy usage in the same way,"Banks report on renewable energy credits, while fuel cell manufacturers report on direct renewable energy generation",Neither industry is required to report on renewable energy usage,"A. Banks report on financed renewable projects, while fuel cell manufacturers report on their own energy consumption","Commercial banks are required to report on their financed emissions, including those related to renewable energy projects they finance (FN-CB-3, FN-CB-4). Fuel cell manufacturers, on the other hand, report on their own energy consumption, including the percentage of renewable energy used in their operations (RR-FC-130a.1).",['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Metrics'],"['151-154', '448-449']","Commercial banks finance the development of sustainable technologies like fuel cells; thus, their investment strategies affect sustainability.","['b16-commercial-banks', 'b42-fuel-cells-and-industrial-batteries']"
3,How do the IFRS sustainability reporting standards differ in their approach to product efficiency for commercial banks versus fuel cell manufacturers?,"Banks focus on financial product efficiency, while fuel cell manufacturers focus on energy efficiency",Both industries have identical product efficiency metrics,Only fuel cell manufacturers are required to report on product efficiency,"Banks report on loan efficiency, while fuel cell manufacturers report on manufacturing efficiency",Neither industry has specific product efficiency metrics,"A. Banks focus on financial product efficiency, while fuel cell manufacturers focus on energy efficiency","The IFRS standards require commercial banks to report on the efficiency of their financial products through metrics like financed emissions intensity (FN-CB-4). For fuel cell manufacturers, the focus is on energy efficiency of their products, with metrics such as electrical and thermal efficiency of fuel cells (RR-FC-410a.2) and storage capacity of batteries (RR-FC-410a.1).",['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Metrics'],"['152-153', '450-451']","Commercial banks finance the development of sustainable technologies like fuel cells; thus, their investment strategies affect sustainability.","['b16-commercial-banks', 'b42-fuel-cells-and-industrial-batteries']"
3,"In terms of climate-related risk disclosure, how do the IFRS requirements differ for commercial banks compared to fuel cell manufacturers?","Banks must disclose transition risks of their portfolio, while fuel cells focus on product lifecycle risks",Fuel cell manufacturers must disclose more detailed climate risks than banks,Both industries have identical climate risk disclosure requirements,"Banks only disclose physical climate risks, while fuel cells only disclose transition risks",Neither industry is required to disclose climate-related risks,"A. Banks must disclose transition risks of their portfolio, while fuel cells focus on product lifecycle risks","The IFRS standards require commercial banks to disclose transition risks associated with their loan and investment portfolio, particularly through metrics related to financed emissions (FN-CB-1 to FN-CB-5). Fuel cell manufacturers, on the other hand, focus on disclosing product lifecycle risks through metrics related to energy efficiency, storage capacity, and operating lifetime of their products (RR-FC-410a.1 to RR-FC-410a.5).",['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Metrics'],"['149-154', '450-453']","Commercial banks finance the development of sustainable technologies like fuel cells; thus, their investment strategies affect sustainability.","['b16-commercial-banks', 'b42-fuel-cells-and-industrial-batteries']"
