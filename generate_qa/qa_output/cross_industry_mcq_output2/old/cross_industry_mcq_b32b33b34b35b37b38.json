    "question": "When disclosing GHG emissions for the Electric Utilities & Power Generators and Gas Utilities & Distributors industries, which of the following is a key difference in reporting requirements?",
    "optionA": "Only Electric Utilities report Scope 1 emissions",
    "optionB": "Gas Utilities report emissions from power deliveries, while Electric Utilities do not",
    "optionC": "Electric Utilities report emissions from power deliveries, while Gas Utilities do not",
    "optionD": "Gas Utilities only report Scope 2 emissions",
    "optionE": "Both industries have identical GHG reporting requirements",
    "answer": "C: Electric Utilities report emissions from power deliveries, while Gas Utilities do not",
    "explanation": "The Electric Utilities & Power Generators industry is required to disclose greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with power deliveries (IF-EU-110a.2), while this specific requirement is not present for the Gas Utilities & Distributors industry. Both industries report Scope 1 emissions, but the power delivery emissions disclosure is unique to Electric Utilities.",
