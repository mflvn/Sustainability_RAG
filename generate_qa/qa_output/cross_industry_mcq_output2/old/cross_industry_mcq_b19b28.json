    "question": "When reporting on energy management, what is a key difference in the disclosure requirements between Health Care Delivery and Mortgage Finance industries?",
    "optionA": "Health Care Delivery must report total energy consumed, while Mortgage Finance does not",
    "optionB": "Mortgage Finance must report energy use in mortgaged properties, while Health Care Delivery reports on its own facilities",
    "optionC": "Health Care Delivery must report percentage of renewable energy, while Mortgage Finance does not",
    "optionD": "Mortgage Finance must report energy efficiency of financed properties, while Health Care Delivery reports on its own operations",
    "optionE": "There are no differences in energy reporting requirements between these industries",
    "answer": "C: Health Care Delivery must report percentage of renewable energy, while Mortgage Finance does not",
    "explanation": "According to the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures, Health Care Delivery companies are required to disclose total energy consumed, percentage grid electricity, and percentage renewable energy (HC-DY-130a.1). In contrast, the Mortgage Finance industry does not have a specific requirement to report on energy consumption or renewable energy percentages. Instead, their focus is on environmental risks to mortgaged properties.",

    "explanation": "The IFRS S2 requirements for Health Care Delivery (HC-DY-450a.1) explicitly require companies to address both physical risks to infrastructure due to extreme weather events and changes in morbidity and mortality rates associated with climate change. In contrast, the requirements for Mortgage Finance (FN-MF-450a.1, FN-MF-450a.2, FN-MF-450a.3) focus primarily on the financial risks and impacts of climate change on mortgaged properties and loan portfolios, without addressing broader health impacts.",
