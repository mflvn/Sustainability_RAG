Metric Selection and Calculation,"When calculating fuel efficiency metrics, what is a key difference between the Aerospace & Defense industry and the Industrial Machinery & Goods industry?","Aerospace & Defense uses miles per gallon, while Industrial Machinery & Goods uses gallons per hour","Industrial Machinery & Goods reports sales-weighted metrics, while Aerospace & Defense does not","Aerospace & Defense focuses on air transport, while Industrial Machinery & Goods focuses on ground transport","Industrial Machinery & Goods includes stationary generators, while Aerospace & Defense does not",Both industries use identical fuel efficiency metrics,"D. Industrial Machinery & Goods includes stationary generators, while Aerospace & Defense does not","A key difference in fuel efficiency metrics between these industries is that the Industrial Machinery & Goods industry specifically includes sales-weighted fuel efficiency for stationary generators (RT-IG-410a.3), measured in watts per gallon. The Aerospace & Defense industry does not have a comparable metric for stationary power generation equipment. This reflects the different product portfolios and end-use applications of the two industries, with Industrial Machinery & Goods having a broader range of equipment types to report on.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Aerospace & Defense', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Industrial Machinery & Goods']","['490-491', '531-533']",These industries heavily rely on resource transformation and face substantial environmental and social governance scrutiny.
