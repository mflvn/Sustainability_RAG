    "question": "When reporting on energy management for the Aerospace & Defense and Industrial Machinery & Goods industries, what is a key difference in the required disclosures?",
    "optionA": "Aerospace & Defense must report total self-generated energy, while Industrial Machinery & Goods does not",
    "optionB": "Industrial Machinery & Goods must report percentage of renewable energy, while Aerospace & Defense does not",
    "optionC": "Aerospace & Defense must report energy consumption by fuel type, while Industrial Machinery & Goods does not",
    "optionD": "Industrial Machinery & Goods must report energy intensity, while Aerospace & Defense does not",
    "optionE": "Both industries have identical energy management reporting requirements",
    "answer": "A. Aerospace & Defense must report total self-generated energy, while Industrial Machinery & Goods does not",
    "explanation": "The key difference is that the Aerospace & Defense industry is required to disclose (4) total self-generated energy as part of their energy management metrics (RT-AE-130a.1), while this specific disclosure is not required for the Industrial Machinery & Goods industry (RT-IG-130a.1). Both industries must report total energy consumed, percentage grid electricity, and percentage renewable, but only Aerospace & Defense has the additional requirement for self-generated energy.",

    "optionE": "Both industries have identical emissions reporting requirements",
    "answer": "C. The Chemicals industry must report air quality metrics, while Containers & Packaging does not",
    "explanation": "A key difference in emissions reporting between these industries is that the Chemicals industry is required to disclose air quality metrics, specifically gross global Scope 1 emissions and the percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations (RT-CH-110a.1). The Containers & Packaging industry has similar Scope 1 emissions reporting requirements (RT-CP-110a.1) but does not have specific air quality metrics beyond greenhouse gas emissions. This reflects the different environmental impacts and regulatory focuses of these two industries.",

    "explanation": "Both the Chemicals industry (RT-CH-140a.1, RT-CH-140a.2, RT-CH-140a.3) and the Containers & Packaging industry (RT-CP-140a.1, RT-CP-140a.2, RT-CP-140a.3) have identical water management metric calculations. They both must report: (1) total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress, (3) number of incidents of non-compliance associated with water quality permits, standards, and regulations, and (4) description of water management risks and discussion of strategies and practices to mitigate those risks. The calculation methodologies for these metrics are the same for both industries.",

    "answer": "D. Industrial Machinery & Goods includes stationary generators, while Aerospace & Defense does not",
    "explanation": "A key difference in fuel efficiency metrics between these industries is that the Industrial Machinery & Goods industry specifically includes sales-weighted fuel efficiency for stationary generators (RT-IG-410a.3), measured in watts per gallon. The Aerospace & Defense industry does not have a comparable metric for stationary power generation equipment. This reflects the different product portfolios and end-use applications of the two industries, with Industrial Machinery & Goods having a broader range of equipment types to report on.",

    "answer": "A. Only Containers & Packaging must report on certified sourcing of materials",
    "explanation": "The key difference is that the Containers & Packaging industry has specific supply chain management disclosure requirements related to certified sourcing of materials. They must report on total wood fiber procured and percentage from certified sources (RT-CP-430a.1), as well as total aluminum purchased and percentage from certified sources (RT-CP-430a.2). The Chemicals industry does not have comparable metrics for certified sourcing in their disclosure requirements. This difference reflects the unique supply chain considerations and sustainability concerns specific to the Containers & Packaging industry.",

The Chemicals industry is required to report on revenue from products designed for use-phase resource efficiency (RT-CH-410a.1), which encompasses a broad range of efficiency improvements. In contrast, the Aerospace & Defense industry specifically focuses on fuel economy and emissions in the use-phase, with metrics like revenue from alternative energy-related products (RT-AE-410a.1) and strategies to address fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions of products (RT-AE-410a.2). This difference reflects the distinct environmental impacts and customer priorities of each industry.",
