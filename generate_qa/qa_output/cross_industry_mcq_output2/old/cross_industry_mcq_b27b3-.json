    "optionB": "Percentage of grid electricity",
    "optionC": "Percentage of renewable energy",
    "optionD": "Energy intensity per square meter of retail/manufacturing space",
    "optionE": "Higher heating values (HHV) for fuel usage calculations",
    "answer": "D. Energy intensity per square meter of retail/manufacturing space",
    "explanation": "Both industries are required to disclose total energy consumed, percentage of grid electricity, and percentage of renewable energy. They also must use higher heating values (HHV) for fuel usage calculations. However, energy intensity per square meter is not explicitly required in the IFRS standards for these industries.",

    "answer": "A. Drug Retailers focus on retail space, while Building Products & Furnishings include manufacturing facilities",
    "explanation": "The main difference in energy management reporting between these industries is the scope of operations covered. Drug Retailers primarily focus on energy consumption in retail spaces, as evidenced by their activity metric of 'Total area of retail space'. In contrast, Building Products & Furnishings industry includes energy consumption in manufacturing facilities, with an activity metric of 'Area of manufacturing facilities'.",
