    "explanation": "Asset Management & Custody Activities companies are specifically required to disclose their approach to proxy voting and investee engagement (FN-AC-410a.3), which includes a description of proxy voting policies. This is not a requirement for Commercial Banks. Both industries have requirements related to ESG incorporation, but the specific metrics differ based on the nature of their businesses.",

Both are required to disclose gross emissions intensity by Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions for each industry by asset class (FN-CB-4 for Banks, FN-IN-4 for Insurers).
