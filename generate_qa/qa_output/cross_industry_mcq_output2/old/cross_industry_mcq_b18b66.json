    "optionB": "Revenue from transactions incorporating ESG factors",
    "optionC": "Total energy consumed",

    "optionE": "Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy to manage emissions",
    "answer": "B. Revenue from transactions incorporating ESG factors",
    "explanation": "The Investment Banking & Brokerage industry is specifically required to report on 'Revenue from (1) underwriting, (2) advisory, and (3) securitization transactions incorporating integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, by industry' (FN-IB-410a.1). This metric is not required for the Marine Transportation industry. Both industries are required to report on Scope 1 emissions, total energy consumed, and strategies to manage emissions, while the number of vessels is specific to Marine Transportation.",

    "answer": "C. Gross global Scope 1 emissions",
    "explanation": "Both the Investment Banking & Brokerage and Marine Transportation industries are required to report on gross global Scope 1 emissions. This is evident from the metrics TR-MT-110a.1 for Marine Transportation and the requirement for Investment Banking & Brokerage to report on absolute gross Scope 1 emissions as part of their transition risk exposure (FN-IB-1). The other options are specific to only one of the industries or not required at all.",

    "optionB": "The investment bank should use a different calculation methodology than the marine transportation company",
    "optionC": "Both companies should use the GHG Protocol methodology, but the investment bank must also include facilitated emissions",
    "optionD": "Both companies should calculate and report Scope 1 emissions using the same basic methodology as outlined in the GHG Protocol",

    "answer": "D. Both companies should calculate and report Scope 1 emissions using the same basic methodology as outlined in the GHG Protocol",
    "explanation": "Both the Investment Banking & Brokerage and Marine Transportation industries are required to calculate and report Scope 1 emissions using the methodology contained in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol). This is specified in the reporting requirements for both industries. While the investment bank also needs to report on facilitated emissions, this is separate from its own Scope 1 emissions calculation.",

    "answer": "D. Revenue associated with environmental factors",
    "explanation": "The calculation of revenue associated with environmental factors would differ significantly between the two industries. For Investment Banking & Brokerage, this involves calculating revenue from transactions incorporating ESG factors (FN-IB-410a.1). For Marine Transportation, there is no direct equivalent metric. Other metrics like total energy consumed, Scope 1 emissions, and percentage of renewable energy would use similar calculation methodologies across both industries, while the discussion of long-term strategy is a qualitative metric for both.",

    "answer": "B. The Investment Banking & Brokerage industry focuses more on indirect emissions through financed activities",
    "explanation": "The Investment Banking & Brokerage industry has specific requirements to report on 'facilitated emissions', which are the emissions attributed to their capital markets and financial advisory services (FN-IB-1 and FN-IB-2). This focus on indirect emissions through financed activities is not present in the Marine Transportation industry's requirements.
