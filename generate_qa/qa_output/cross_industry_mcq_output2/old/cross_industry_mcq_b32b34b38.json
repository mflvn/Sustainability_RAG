    "explanation": "A key difference in calculating customer energy savings is the unit of measurement. Electric Utilities & Power Generators report customer electricity savings in megawatt hours (MWh) (IF-EU-420a.3), while Gas Utilities & Distributors report customer gas savings in million British thermal units (MMBtu) (IF-GU-420a.2). This difference reflects the different forms of energy delivered by these utilities and ensures that the reported savings are relevant to their specific operations.",

    "answer": "B. Waste Management includes lifecycle emissions, while Electric Utilities only consider Scope 1 emissions",
    "explanation": "The approach to reporting on emissions reduction strategies differs significantly between these industries. Waste Management companies are required to discuss how lifecycle GHG emissions factor into their management of Scope 1 emissions and overall business strategy (IF-WM-110a.3). This includes considering trade-offs between lifecycle and Scope 1 emissions. In contrast, Electric Utilities & Power Generators are primarily focused on discussing their strategy to manage Scope 1 emissions (IF-EU-110a.3), without an explicit requirement to consider lifecycle emissions. This difference reflects the broader environmental impact considerations in the Waste Management industry.",
