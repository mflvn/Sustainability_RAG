Metric Comparison,How do the activity metrics for data processing capacity differ between the Software & IT Services and Internet Media & Services industries?,"Software & IT Services uses MFLOPS, while Internet Media & Services uses MIPS","Internet Media & Services includes rack space, while Software & IT Services doesn't","Software & IT Services measures in petabytes, while Internet Media & Services uses gigabytes","Internet Media & Services considers only cloud services, while Software & IT Services includes on-premise solutions",There is no significant difference in how they measure data processing capacity,E. There is no significant difference in how they measure data processing capacity,"Both industries use the same approach for measuring data processing capacity. They both allow for reporting in units such as Million Service Units (MSUs), Million Instructions per Second (MIPS), Mega Floating-Point Operations per Second (MFLOPS), compute cycles, or other units typically tracked by the entity. Both also allow for alternative measures such as rack space or data center square footage, and include the same types of services in the percentage outsourced calculation.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Internet Media & Services', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Software & IT Services']","['560', '577']",Both industries heavily rely on data centers and digital infrastructures that consume significant energy.
