    "explanation": "Both industries show a growing emphasis on water stress and scarcity in their sourcing and operations. The Household & Personal Products industry requires reporting on water withdrawn and consumed in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress (CG-HP-140a.1). Similarly, the Processed Foods industry not only requires reporting on water stress for direct operations (FB-PF-140a.1) but also extends this to ingredient sourcing (FB-PF-440a.1), asking for the percentage of food ingredients sourced from regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress. This trend reflects the increasing importance of water management and the recognition of water scarcity as a critical issue in both industries.",
