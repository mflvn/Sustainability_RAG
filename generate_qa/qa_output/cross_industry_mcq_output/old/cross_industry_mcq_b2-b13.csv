Cross-Industry Comparison,How do the Appliance Manufacturing and Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing industries differ in their approach to managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions?,"Appliance Manufacturing focuses on product energy efficiency, while Oil & Gas Refining focuses on direct emissions from operations",Both industries primarily focus on Scope 3 emissions,Appliance Manufacturing has no GHG emissions to manage,Oil & Gas Refining only manages emissions through carbon offsets,Both industries have identical approaches to GHG emissions management,"A: Appliance Manufacturing focuses on product energy efficiency, while Oil & Gas Refining focuses on direct emissions from operations","The Appliance Manufacturing industry focuses on product lifecycle environmental impacts, including energy efficiency certifications for products (CG-AM-410a.1), which indirectly reduces GHG emissions during product use. In contrast, the Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing industry directly manages Scope 1 GHG emissions from their operations (EM-RM-110a.1 and EM-RM-110a.2), including strategies to reduce emissions from various sources like flaring, combustion, and process emissions.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Appliance Manufacturing', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Refining & Marketing']","['12', '116-120']",Resource-intensive manufacturing in appliance production can be compared with the heavy industrial processes and significant emissions found in oil refining.,"['b2-appliance-manufacturing', 'b13-oil-and-gas-refining-and-marketing']"
Metric Comparison,Which sustainability metric is common to both the Appliance Manufacturing and Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing industries?,Percentage of products certified to energy efficiency standards,Total fresh water withdrawn,Gross global Scope 1 emissions,Percentage of revenue from advanced biofuels,Number of units produced annually,B: Total fresh water withdrawn,"While both industries have different focal points for sustainability, water management is a common concern. The Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing industry explicitly measures 'Total fresh water withdrawn' (EM-RM-140a.1). Although not directly stated for Appliance Manufacturing, water efficiency is implied in their product lifecycle considerations and sustainability standards (CG-AM-410a.2). Both industries are water-intensive and likely track fresh water withdrawal, making this the most relevant common metric.","['IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Appliance Manufacturing', 'IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures Appendix B Industry-based disclosure requirements: Oil & Gas – Refining & Marketing']","['12-14', '121-122']",Resource-intensive manufacturing in appliance production can be compared with the heavy industrial processes and significant emissions found in oil refining.,"['b2-appliance-manufacturing', 'b13-oil-and-gas-refining-and-marketing']"
