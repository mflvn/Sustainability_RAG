    "question": "How do the Apparel, Accessories & Footwear and Coal Operations industries differ in their approach to managing environmental risks in their supply chains?",
    "optionA": "Apparel focuses on raw material sourcing, while Coal focuses on water management",
    "optionB": "Coal focuses on greenhouse gas emissions, while Apparel focuses on labor practices",
    "optionC": "Apparel emphasizes animal welfare, while Coal emphasizes land reclamation",
    "optionD": "Coal prioritizes air quality, while Apparel prioritizes chemical management",
    "optionE": "Both industries have identical environmental risk management approaches",
    "answer": "A. Apparel focuses on raw material sourcing, while Coal focuses on water management",
    "explanation": "The Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry emphasizes environmental risks associated with sourcing priority raw materials, as evidenced by metric CG-AA-440a.1. In contrast, the Coal Operations industry focuses on water management, with metrics EM-CO-140a.1 and EM-CO-140a.2 addressing water withdrawal, recycling, and compliance with water quality regulations.",

    "question": "Which sustainability metric is common to both the Apparel, Accessories & Footwear and Coal Operations industries, but measured differently?",
    "optionA": "Greenhouse gas emissions",
    "optionB": "Water consumption",
    "optionC": "Energy efficiency",
    "optionD": "Waste management",
    "optionE": "Biodiversity impact",
    "answer": "B. Water consumption",
    "explanation": "Both industries measure water consumption, but differently. The Apparel industry focuses on the percentage of raw materials third-party certified to sustainability standards (CG-AA-440a.2), which can include water efficiency. The Coal industry directly measures total fresh water withdrawn, percentage recycled, and percentage in water-stressed regions (EM-CO-140a.1).",

    "optionE": "Expanding use of blockchain for supply chain traceability",
    "answer": "D. Heightened attention to climate-related financial risks",
    "explanation": "Both industries show a trend towards increased attention to climate-related financial risks. The Apparel industry addresses this through raw materials sourcing risks (CG-AA-440a.1), while the Coal industry directly addresses it through sensitivity analysis of coal reserves to carbon pricing scenarios (EM-CO-420a.1) and discussion of how climate regulation influences capital expenditure strategies (EM-CO-420a.3).",
