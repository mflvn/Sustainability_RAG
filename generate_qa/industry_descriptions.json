Insurance companies generally operate within a single segment in the industry, e.g., property and casualty, although there are some large insurance companies with diversified operations. Similarly, companies may vary based on the level of their geographic segmentation. While large companies may underwrite insurance premiums in multiple countries, smaller companies generally operate at a national or even local level. Insurance premiums, underwriting revenue, and investment income drive industry growth, while insurance claim payments present the most significant cost and source of uncertainty for profits. Insurance companies provide products and services that enable the transfer, pooling, and sharing of risk necessary for a well-functioning economy. Insurance companies, through their products, can also create a form of moral hazard, lowering incentives to improve underlying behavior and performance, and thus contributing to sustainability impacts. Similar to other financial institutions, insurance companies face risks associated with credit and financial markets. Within the industry, companies that engage in non-traditional or non-insurance activities, including credit default swaps (CDS) protection and debt securities insurance, have been identified by regulators as being more vulnerable to financial market developments, and subsequently, more likely to amplify or contribute to systemic risk. As a result, insurance companies face the potential of being designated as Systemically Important Financial Institutions, thus exposing them to enhanced regulation and oversight.",

    "b34-gas-utilities-and-distributors": "The Gas Utilities & Distributors industry is made up of gas distribution and marketing companies. Gas distribution involves operating local, low-pressure pipes to transfer natural gas from larger transmission pipes to end users. Gas marketing companies are gas brokers that aggregate natural gas into quantities that fit the needs of their different customers and then deliver it, generally through other companies' transmission and distribution lines. A relatively smaller portion of this industry is involved in propane gas distribution; therefore this standard is focused on natural gas distribution. Both types of gas are commonly used for heating and cooking by residential, commercial, and industrial customers. In structurally regulated markets, the utility is granted a full monopoly over the distribution and sale of natural gas. A regulator must approve the rates utilities charge to avoid the abuse of their monopoly position. In deregulated markets, distribution and marketing are legally separated and customers have a choice of which company to buy their gas from. In this case, a utility is guaranteed a monopoly only over distribution and is legally required to transmit all gas equitably along its pipes for a fixed fee. Overall, companies in the industry are tasked with providing safe, reliable, low-cost gas, while effectively managing their social and environmental impacts, such as community safety and methane emissions.",

Transportation logistics services include contracting with road, rail, marine, and air freight companies to select and hire appropriate transportation. Services can also include customs brokerage, distribution management, vendor consolidation, cargo insurance, purchase-order management, and customized logistics information. The industry is key to global trade, granting it a degree of demand stability.",
    "b61-airlines": "The Airlines industry is comprised of companies that provide air transportation globally to passengers for both leisure and business purposes. This includes commercial full-service, low-cost, and regional airlines. Full-service carriers typically use a hub-and-spoke model to design their routes within countries and internationally. Low-cost carriers usually offer a smaller number of routes as well as no-frills service to their customers. Regional carriers typically operate under contract to full-service carriers, expanding the network of the larger carriers. Many airline companies also have a cargo segment in their operations from which they generate additional revenue. It is common within the industry for companies to form partnerships or join alliances in order to increase network size. Operating as an alliance allows airlines to offer customers access to international or otherwise underserved itineraries on multiple airlines under one ticket. At the same time, airlines share some overhead costs and increase their competitive position in the global market without having to operate outside their home country.",
    "b62-auto-parts": "Companies in the Auto Parts industry supply motor vehicle parts and accessories to original equipment manufacturers (OEM). Auto parts companies typically specialize in the manufacturing and assembly of certain parts or accessories, such as engine exhaust systems, alternative drivetrains, hybrid systems, catalytic converters, aluminum wheels (rims), tires, rearview mirrors, and onboard electrical and electronic equipment. Although the larger automotive industry includes several tiers of suppliers that provide parts and raw materials used to assemble motor vehicles, the scope of SASB's Auto Parts industry includes only Tier 1 suppliers that supply parts directly to OEMs. The scope of the industry excludes captive suppliers, such as engine and stamping facilities, that are owned and operated by OEMs. Similarity, it excludes Tier 2 suppliers, which provide inputs for the Auto Parts industry.",
    "b63-automobiles": "The Automobiles industry includes companies that manufacture passenger vehicles, light trucks, and motorcycles. Industry players design, build, and sell vehicles that run using a range of traditional and alternative fuels and powertrains. They sell these vehicles to dealers for consumer retail sales as well as sell directly to fleet customers, including car rental and leasing companies, commercial fleets, and governments. Due to the global nature of this industry, nearly all companies have manufacturing facilities, assembly plants, and service locations in several countries around the world. The Automobiles industry is highly concentrated, with a few large manufacturers and a diversified supply chain. Given the industry's reliance on natural resources and sensitivity to the business cycle, revenues are typically cyclical.",
    "b64-car-rental-and-leasing": "Companies in this industry rent or lease passenger vehicles to customers. Car rentals are typically for periods of less than a month, while leases are for a year or more. The industry includes car-sharing business models where rentals are measured hourly and typically include subscription fees. Car rental companies operate out of airport locations, which serve business and leisure travelers, and out of neighborhood locations, which mostly provide repair-shop and weekend rentals. The industry is concentrated, with several dominant market players, who operate globally using a franchise model. The growth of public transit and ride-sharing services in major metropolitan areas may represent a threat to the long-term profitability of the Car Rental & Leasing industry if customers chose to hail rides or take public transit rather than rent vehicles.",
    "b65-cruise-lines": "The Cruise Lines industry comprises companies that provide passenger transportation and leisure entertainment, including deep sea cruises and river cruises. The industry is dominated by a few large companies. Cruises aim to provide a luxury resort experience for thousands of passengers at a time.

Due to the global scope of the industry, companies operate in many countries and under diverse legal and regulatory frameworks.",
    "b67-rail-transportation": "The Rail Transportation industry consists of companies that provide rail freight shipping and support services. Key activities include shipping containerized and bulk freight, including consumer goods and commodities. Rail companies typically own, maintain, and operate their rail networks, which may require significant capital expenditures. The U.S. operates the longest railroad network in the world, followed closely by Russia, China, India, Canada, Germany, and France. The industry exhibits economies of density due to its network effects, lending itself to natural monopoly conditions. Together with the large sunk costs of rail infrastructure, this provides a competitive advantage to incumbent firms in the industry and creates barriers to entry for new firms.",
    "b68-road-transportation": "The Road Transportation industry consists of companies that provide long- and short-haul freight trucking services. Key activities include the shipment of containerized and bulk freight, including consumer goods and a wide variety of commodities. The industry is commonly broken down into two categories: truckload (vehicles carrying the goods of only one customer) and less-than-truckload (vehicles carrying the goods of multiple customers). Owner-operators comprise the vast majority of the industry due to the relative ease of entry, while a few large operators maintain market share through contracts with major shippers. Large companies often subcontract with owner-operators to supplement their owned fleet.",
    "b23-meat-poultry-and-dairy": "The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry produces raw and processed animal products, including meats, eggs, and dairy products, for human and animal consumption. Key activities include animal raising, slaughtering, processing, and packaging. The industry's largest companies have international operations, and companies are vertically integrated to varying degrees, depending on the type of animal produced.

Large companies operate globally, and international opportunities are driving growth.",
    "b27-drug-retailers": "The Drug Retailers industry comprises companies that operate retail pharmacies and distribution centers that supply retail stores. Stores may be company-owned or franchised. Large companies source drugs and other merchandise through wholesalers and distributors. The majority of the industry's revenues are derived from consumer sales of prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products; other goods sold include household goods, personal care products, and a limited selection of groceries. Additionally, the pharmacy retailer segment is expanding its health-focused services by offering clinics at various retail locations, which adds to the industry's shifting sustainability landscape.",
    "b29-health-care-distributors": "Health care distributors purchase, inventory, and sell pharmaceutical products and medical equipment to hospitals, pharmacies, and physicians. Demand for the industry's services is driven largely by rates of insurance, pharmaceutical spending, illness, and demographics. The health care sector continues to face an emphasis on reduced costs and improved efficiencies, which will also impact the Health Care Distributors industry. Companies in this industry face challenges from consolidation and partnerships between pharmacies, payers, and manufacturers.",

The increased prevalence of diseases associated with unhealthy lifestyles and an aging population are important factors that may impact growth in this industry. Emerging markets and the expansion of health insurance in the U.S. will contribute to further growth. However, the extension of government insurance programs, provider and payer consolidation, and regulatory emphasis on reduced costs in all markets may result in downward pricing pressure.",
