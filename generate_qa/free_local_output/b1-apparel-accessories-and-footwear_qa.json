    "question": "What are the key environmental and social risks associated with sourcing priority raw materials in the Apparel, Accessories & Footwear industry?",
    "answer": "The key environmental risks include climate change impacts on natural fiber crop production, legislation on greenhouse gases affecting petroleum-derived raw material prices, tightening environmental regulations for suppliers, lack of full traceability to raw material sources, and improper land use practices. The key social risks include suppliers' animal welfare, labor, and human rights practices, and sourcing materials from regions of conflict. The entity should discuss its vulnerability to cotton-growing regions with water stress and how it manages the risk of price variability due to sourcing cotton from these regions.",
