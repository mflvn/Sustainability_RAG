The metric should be calculated as the total amount of palm oil sourced, with no consideration for RSPO certification.\nB: The code is CG-HP-430b.2. The metric should be calculated as the percentage of RSPO-certified palm oil, regardless of the supply chain model.\nC: The code is CG-HP-430a.1. The metric should be calculated as the amount of palm oil sourced and the percentage certified through RSPO supply chains, broken down by four specific models.\nD: The code is CG-HP-430c.3. The metric should be calculated as the ratio of certified to non-certified palm oil, without specifying RSPO supply chain models.\nE: The code is CG-HP-430c.1. The metric should be calculated as the amount of palm oil sourced and the percentage certified through RSPO supply chains, broken down by four specific models.\n\nPlease provide the correct answer and explain why it's correct based on the following reference:\nCG-HP-430a.1.

Key takeaways are to focus on increasing palm oil usage and maximizing yield without considering environmental impacts.\nB: The section covers palm oil alternatives. Key takeaways are to completely eliminate palm oil from supply chains and replace it with synthetic substitutes.\nC: The section covers palm oil sourcing and certification. Key takeaways are to disclose the amount of palm oil sourced, ensure RSPO certification, and consider the environmental and social risks associated with palm oil in the supply chain.\nD: The section covers palm oil transportation. Key takeaways are to optimize logistics for palm oil delivery and reduce transportation-related emissions.\nE: The section covers palm oil sourcing only. Key takeaways are to disclose the source of the palm oil and the amount sourced.\n\nPlease provide the correct answer and explain why it's correct based on the following reference:\nPalm oil harvesting in specific regions of the world can contribute to deforestation, GHG emissions, and other environmental and social problems. If not sourced responsibly, palm oil materials contribute to environmental and social externalities that can present reputational and regulatory risks for companies.\nCompanies face pressure to track and responsibly source palm oil.
