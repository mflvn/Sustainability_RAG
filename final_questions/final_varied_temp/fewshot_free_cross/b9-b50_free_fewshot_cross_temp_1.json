    "question": "Are there any common sustainability topics between the Iron & Steel Producers and Industrial Machinery & Goods industries? If so, how do their reporting requirements differ?",
    "answer": "Yes, both industries have the common sustainability topic of 'Energy Management.' For Industrial Machinery & Goods, the metric is 'RT-IG-130a.1' which requires disclosure of (1) total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable. For Iron & Steel Producers, the metric 'EM-IS-130a.1' requires disclosure of (1) total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable. Although both industries report on total energy consumed and percentages of grid and renewable energy, their codes and specific requirements may differ in context and scope.",
