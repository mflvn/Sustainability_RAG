    "answer": "The Industrial Machinery & Goods industry has five quantitative metrics in Table 1: (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable, Sales-weighted fleet fuel efficiency for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, Sales-weighted fuel efficiency for non-road equipment, Sales-weighted fuel efficiency for stationary generators, and Sales-weighted emissions of: (1) nitrogen oxides (NOx) and (2) particulate matter (PM) for various engines. The Iron & Steel Producers industry has four quantitative metrics in Table 1: Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations, (1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable, (1) Total fuel consumed, (2) percentage coal, (3) percentage natural gas, (4) percentage renewable, and (1) Total fresh water withdrawn, (2) percentage recycled, (3) percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress.",
