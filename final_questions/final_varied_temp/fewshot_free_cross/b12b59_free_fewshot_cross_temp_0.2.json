    "answer": "Yes, both industries address the topic of emissions and energy consumption. In the Oil & Gas-Midstream industry, the focus is on \"Greenhouse Gas Emissions\" with metrics like \"Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage methane, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations\" and \"Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets.\" In contrast, the Telecommunication Services industry focuses on the \"Environmental Footprint of Operations\" with metrics such as \"(1) Total energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, (3) percentage renewable.\" The Oil & Gas-Midstream industry requires both quantitative and discussion-based metrics, while the Telecommunication Services industry focuses on quantitative metrics related to energy consumption.",
