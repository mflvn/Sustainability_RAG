    "question": "What does the IFRS require companies to disclose regarding the incorporation of ESG factors in credit analysis for the Commercial Banks industry?",
    "answer": "The entity shall describe its approach to the incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into its credit analysis. The scope of disclosure shall include commercial and industrial lending as well as project finance. The entity shall describe policies that determine its approach to the incorporation of ESG factors in credit analysis. The entity shall discuss how it incorporates ESG factors when estimating credit losses over the contractual term of the entity's financial assets. The entity shall describe its approach to implementation of the aspects of the entity's ESG incorporation practices. The entity shall describe its oversight/accountability approach to the incorporation of ESG factors. The entity shall discuss whether it conducts scenario analysis and/or modeling in which the risk profile of future ESG trends is calculated at the portfolio level of commercial and industrial credit exposure. The entity shall discuss ESG trends that it views as broadly applicable in terms of their impact on sectors and industries, as well as the trends it views as sector- or industry-specific. The entity shall describe significant concentrations of credit exposure to ESG factors, including, but not limited to, carbon-related assets, water-stressed regions, and cybersecurity risks. The entity shall describe how ESG factors are incorporated in the assessment of and influence the entity's perspectives on traditional macroeconomic factors, traditional microeconomic factors, overall creditworthiness of a borrower, maturity or tenor of a loan, expected loss, and value of posted collateral. The entity may disclose additional quantitative measures related to its approach to the incorporation of ESG factors in credit analysis.",

      "As financial intermediaries, commercial banks contribute to significant positive and negative environmental and social externalities through their lending practices. Therefore, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors can have material implications for the underlying companies, assets, and projects that commercial banks lend to across a range of industries. It is therefore increasingly necessary for companies to examine ESG factors when determining the quality of collateral. Commercial banks also have the potential to enable positive environmental and social externalities and to generate significant revenue streams through their lending practices. Commercial banks that fail to address these risks and opportunities could face diminished returns and reduced value for shareholders. Commercial banks should subsequently disclose how ESG factors are integrated into lending processes and the current level of portfolio risk associated with specific sustainability trends. In particular, investor and regulatory pressure is mounting for banks to disclose how they address climate change related risks.",
