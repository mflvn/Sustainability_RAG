    "answer": "The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources. The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations. The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40-80 percent) or Extremely High (>80 percent) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct. The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn. The entity shall disclose its water consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water consumed.",

Water consumption is defined as water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge; water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service; and water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea.",
