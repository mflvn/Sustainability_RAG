    "answer": "The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations. Water consumption is defined as: Water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge; Water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service; Water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea.",
