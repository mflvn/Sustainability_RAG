    "question": "What is the code of the 'Total water withdrawn and consumed' metric in the Electronic Manufacturing Services & Original Design Manufacturing industry and how should this metric be disclosed?",
    "answer": "The code of the 'Total water withdrawn and consumed' metric in the Electronic Manufacturing Services & Original Design Manufacturing industry is TC-ES-140a.1. The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources. The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations. Water consumption is defined as water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge; water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service; and water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea.",
