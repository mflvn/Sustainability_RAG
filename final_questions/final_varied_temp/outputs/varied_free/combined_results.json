    "question": "Describe the calculation method for the gross exposure to carbon-related industries metric for the Commercial Banks industry.",
    "answer": "The entity shall disclose its gross exposure to carbon-related industries, by industry. For funded amounts, gross exposure is defined as the funded carrying amounts expressed in the presentation currency of the entity's financial statements whether prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards or other GAAP. Carrying amount means the amount before subtracting the loss allowance, when applicable. For undrawn loan commitments, gross exposure is defined as the full amount of the commitment expressed in the presentation currency of the entity's financial statements. For derivatives, gross exposure is defined as the contractual amounts to be exchanged in a derivative for which gross cash flows are exchanged, or the net amounts in a derivative for which net cash flows are exchanged, as applicable, expressed in the presentation currency of the entity's financial statements. Carbon-related industries are industries responsible for relatively high direct or indirect GHG emissions. Carbon related industries include but are not limited to: Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels, Chemicals, Construction Materials, Metals & Mining, and Paper & Forest Products, Air Freight & Logistics, Airlines, Marine, and Road & Rail, Automobiles, Homebuilding, Beverages and Food Products, Electric Utilities, Gas Utilities and Multi Utilities, Real Estate Management & Development.
