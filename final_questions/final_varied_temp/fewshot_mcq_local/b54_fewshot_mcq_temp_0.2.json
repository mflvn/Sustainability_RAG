      "## Topic Summary",
      "The manufacturing of computers, computer components, and other electronics requires significant volumes of water. Water is becoming a scarce resource around the globe, due to increasing consumption from population growth and rapid urbanization, and reduced supplies due to climate change. Without careful planning, water scarcity can result in higher supply costs, social tensions with local communities and governments, and/or loss of access to water in water-scarce regions thereby presenting a critical risk to production, and thus revenues. Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) & Original Design Manufacturing (ODM) companies that are able to increase the efficiency of water use during manufacturing can reduce operating costs and maintain a lower risk profile, ultimately impacting cost of capital and market valuation. Furthermore, firms that prioritize reducing water use and greater efficiency can face lower regulatory risks as local, regional, and national environmental laws place increasing emphasis on resource conservation."
