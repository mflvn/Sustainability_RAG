      "## Topic Summary",
      "Companies in the Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) & Original Design Manufacturing (ODM) industry, along with the industry's customers such as hardware companies, face increasing challenges associated with environmental externalities attributed to product manufacturing, transport, use, and disposal. Rapid obsolescence of hardware products exacerbates such externalities. The industry's products commonly contain hazardous materials, making safe end-of-life disposal a critical aspect to manage. Companies unable to minimize the environmental externalities of their products may face increased regulatory costs as local, regional, and national environmental laws place increasing emphasis on resource conservation and waste management. Through product innovation that facilitates end-of-life product recovery and the use of less-impactful materials, EMS & ODM manufacturers can achieve improvements in lifecycle impacts, reduce regulatory risk, and realize cost savings."
