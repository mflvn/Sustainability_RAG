The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and energy management strategies depends on the type of products manufactured. A company's energy mix, including the use of electricity generated on-site, grid-sourced electricity, and the use of alternative energy, can play an important role in influencing the cost and reliability of energy supply, and ultimately affect the company's cost structure and regulatory risk.",

Sustainability impacts related to climate change, land use, resource scarcity, and conflict in regions where the industry's supply chain operates are increasingly shaping the industry's ability to source materials. The ability of companies to manage potential materials shortages, supply disruptions, price volatility, and reputational risks is made more difficult by the fact that they source materials from geographically diverse regions through supply chains that often lack transparency. Failure to effectively manage this issue can lead to reduced margins, constrained revenue growth, and/or higher costs capital. The types of risk associated with sourcing different materials can require different solutions, including engaging with suppliers, enhancing transparency, using certification standards, and/or using innovative alternative materials. Companies that are most proactive are likely to reduce their exposure to price volatility and potential supply disruptions, while improving their brand reputation and developing new market opportunities.",

        "Refineries can use relatively large quantities of water depending on their size and the complexity of the refining process. This exposes them to the risk of reduced water availability, depending on their location, and related costs. Extraction of water from water-stressed regions or water contamination may also create tensions with local communities. Refinery operations often require wastewater treatment and disposal, often via on-site wastewater treatment plants before discharge. Reducing water use and contamination through recycling and other water management strategies may result in operational efficiencies for companies and lower their operating costs. They could also minimize the impacts of regulations, water supply shortages, and community-related disruptions on operations.",

      "answer": "For the 'Water Management' topic in the Alcoholic Beverages industry, the entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was withdrawn from all sources. Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities. The entity may disclose portions of its supply by source if, for example, significant portions of withdrawals are from non-freshwater sources. The entity shall disclose the amount of water, in thousands of cubic meters, that was consumed in its operations. Water consumption is defined as water that evaporates during withdrawal, usage, and discharge; water that is directly or indirectly incorporated into the entity's product or service; and water that does not otherwise return to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn, such as water returned to another catchment area or the sea. The entity shall analyze all of its operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High (40\u201380 percent) or Extremely High (>80 percent) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct. The entity shall disclose its water withdrawn in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water withdrawn. The entity shall disclose its water consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress as a percentage of the total water consumed. The entity shall describe its water management risks associated with water withdrawals, water consumption, and discharge of water and/or wastewater. Risks associated with water withdrawals and water consumption include risks to the availability of adequate, clean water resources, including, but not limited to, environmental constraints\u2014such as operating in water-stressed regions, drought, concerns of aquatic impingement or entrainment, interannual or seasonal variability, and risks due to the impact of climate change; regulatory and financial constraints\u2014such as volatility in water costs, stakeholder perceptions and concerns related to water withdrawals (e.g., those from local communities, non-governmental organizations, and regulatory agencies), direct competition with and impact from the actions of other users (e.g., commercial and municipal users), restrictions to withdrawals due to regulations, and constraints on the entity's ability to obtain and retain water rights or permits. Risks associated with the discharge of water and/or wastewater, include, but are not limited to, the ability to obtain rights or permits related to discharges, compliance with regulations related to discharges, restrictions to discharges, the ability to maintain control over the temperature of water discharges, liabilities and/or reputational risks, and increased operating costs due to regulation, stakeholder perceptions and concerns related to water discharges (e.g., those from local communities, non-governmental organizations, and regulatory agencies). The entity may describe water management risks in the context of how risks may vary by withdrawal source, including surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the entity, and water and wastewater obtained from municipal water supplies, water utilities, or other entities; and how risks may vary by discharge destinations, including surface water, groundwater, or wastewater utilities. The entity may discuss the potential impacts that water management risks may have on its operations and the timeline over which such risks are expected to manifest. Impacts may include, but are not limited to, those associated with costs, revenues, liabilities, continuity of operations, and reputation. The entity shall discuss its short-term and long-term strategies or plan to mitigate water management risks, including, but not limited to, the scope of its strategy, plans, goals and/or targets, such as how they relate to different business units, geographies, or water-consuming operational processes. Any water management goals and/or targets it has prioritized, and an analysis of performance against those goals and/or targets. Goals and targets may include, but are not limited to, those associated with reducing water withdrawals, reducing water consumption, reducing water discharges, reducing aquatic impingements, improving the quality of water discharges, and regulatory compliance. The activities and investments required to achieve the plans, goals and/or targets, and any risks or limiting factors that might affect achievement of the plans and/or targets. Disclosure of strategies, plans, goals, and/or targets shall be limited to activities that were ongoing (active) or reached completion during the reporting period. For water management targets, the entity shall additionally disclose whether the target is absolute or intensity-based, and the metric denominator if it is an intensity-based target. The timelines for the water management activities, including the start year, the target year, and the base year. The mechanism(s) for achieving the target, including efficiency efforts, such as the use of water recycling and/or closed-loop systems; product innovations such as redesigning products or services to require less water; process and equipment innovations, such as those that enable the reduction of aquatic impingements or entrainments; use of tools and technologies (e.g., the World Wildlife Fund Water Risk Filter, The Global Water Tool, and Water Footprint Network Footprint Assessment Tool) to analyze water use, risk, and opportunities; and collaborations or programs in place with the community or other organizations. The percentage reduction or improvement from the base year, where the base year is the first year against which water management targets are evaluated toward the achievement of the target. The entity shall discuss whether its water management practices result in any additional lifecycle impacts or tradeoffs in its organization, including tradeoffs in land use, energy production, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and why the entity chose these practices despite lifecycle tradeoffs.",

      "answer": "For the 'Energy Management' topic in the Chemicals industry, the entity shall disclose (1) the total amount of energy it consumed as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ). The scope of energy consumption includes energy from all sources, including energy purchased from sources external to the entity and energy produced by the entity itself (self-generated). For example, direct fuel usage, purchased electricity, and heating, cooling, and steam energy are all included within the scope of energy consumption. The scope of energy consumption includes only energy directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period. In calculating energy consumption from fuels and biofuels, the entity shall use higher heating values (HHV), also known as gross calorific values (GCV), which are directly measured or taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The entity shall disclose (2) the percentage of energy it consumed that was supplied from grid electricity. The percentage shall be calculated as purchased grid electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption. The entity shall disclose (3) the percentage of energy it consumed that is renewable energy. Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are replenished at a rate greater than or equal to their rate of depletion, such as geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and biomass. The percentage shall be calculated as renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption. The scope of renewable energy includes renewable fuel the entity consumed, renewable energy the entity directly produced, and renewable energy the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) that explicitly includes renewable energy certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs), a Green-e Energy Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity. For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs must be retained (i.e., not sold) and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy. For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement must explicitly include and convey that RECs and GOs be retained or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy. The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity is excluded from the scope of renewable energy. For the purposes of this disclosure, the scope of renewable energy from biomass sources is limited to materials certified to a third-party standard (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable Forest Initiative, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, or American Tree Farm System), materials considered eligible sources of supply according to the Green-e Framework for Renewable Energy Certification, Version 1.0 (2017) or Green-e regional standards, and/or materials that are eligible for an applicable state renewable portfolio standard. The entity shall disclose (4) the amount of energy self-generated by the entity as an aggregate figure, in gigajoules (GJ). The entity may disclose the amount of self-generated energy that it sold to an electric utility or end-use customer. The entity may disclose the amount of self-generated energy that was renewable energy, where renewable energy is defined above. The entity shall apply conversion factors consistently for all data reported under this disclosure, such as the use of HHVs for fuel usage (including biofuels) and conversion of kilowatt hours (kWh) to GJ (for energy data including electricity from solar or wind energy). The entity shall discuss its efforts to reduce energy consumption and/or improve energy efficiency throughout the manufacturing and production processes. The entity shall discuss implementation of Green Chemistry Principle 6, 'Design for Energy Efficiency,' including, where relevant, efforts such as conducting reactions at ambient temperature and pressure, reducing key materials that require energy-intensive processing (e.g., distillation and drying), using excess steam and heat to generate energy, improving catalytic processes, and other process improvements that result in gains in energy efficiency. Relevant strategies to discuss include the use of incremental improvement, the implementation of best practice technology, the use of emerging technologies, and the development of 'game changers,' consistent with the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) Technology Road Map. The entity may disclose the aggregate energy savings (in gigajoules) achieved through such efforts and processes.",

        "# Energy Management",
        "## Topic Summary",
        "Chemical manufacturing is typically energy-intensive, with energy used to power processing units, cogeneration plants, machinery, and non-manufacturing facilities. The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and energy management strategies depends on the type of products manufactured. Typically, fossil fuels including natural gas and natural gas liquids are the predominant form of non-feedstock energy used, while purchased electricity may also represent a significant share. Therefore, energy purchases can represent a significant share of production costs. A company's energy mix may include energy generated onsite, purchased grid electricity and fossil fuels, and renewable and alternative energy. Tradeoffs in the use of such energy sources include cost, reliability of supply, related water use and air emissions, and regulatory compliance and risk. As such, a company's energy intensity and energy sourcing decisions may affect its operating efficiency and risk profile over time.",

        "# Transition Risk Exposure",
        "Risks and opportunities relating to the transition to a lower-carbon economy can have significant implications for the entities, assets, and projects that investment banks service either through the provision of finance and/or other capital markets activities and financial advisory services. With respect to the latter, policy change, technological innovation and shifting market dynamics, can give rise to transition risks including reputational damage which could ultimately impact the bank's enterprise value. Alternatively, the transition to a lower-carbon economy could open new market opportunities leading to increased revenue. Measuring and disclosing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the provision of core products and services such as underwriting, advisory and securitisation activities\u2014a concept known as 'facilitated emissions'\u2014can provide useful information to enable users of general purpose financial reporting to assess implications for the revenue generated by the entity's capital markets activities.",
        "# Greenhouse Gas Emissions",
        "Marine transportation companies generate emissions mainly from the combustion of diesel in ship engines. The industry's reliance on heavy fuel oil (\"bunker fuel\") is of material concern due to rising fuel costs and intensifying greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations. The industry is among the most fuel efficient of the major transportation modes in terms of fuel use per ton shipped. However, due to the size of the industry, its contribution to the global GHG inventory is still significant. Recent environmental regulations are driving the adoption of more fuel-efficient engines and the use of cleaner-burning fuels. Fuel constitutes a major expense for industry players, providing a further incentive for investing in upgrades or retrofits to boost fuel efficiency."

The type of energy used, magnitude of consumption, and energy management strategies depends on the type of products manufactured. A company's energy mix, including the use of electricity generated on-site, grid-sourced electricity, and the use of alternative energy, can play an important role in influencing the cost and reliability of energy supply, and ultimately affect the company's cost structure and regulatory risk.",

As such, companies that provide these oil and gas producers with services have developed technologies and processes such as closed-loop water recycling systems to reduce customers' water consumption and disposal costs. These offerings provide service companies the potential to gain market share and increase revenues, as management of drilling and wastewater can be a significant competitive factor for their customers."

        "Insurance companies are responsible for investing capital to ensure the preservation of premium revenues equivalent to expected policy claim payouts and must be able to maintain this asset-liability parity over the long term. As environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors have increasingly been shown to have a material impact on the performance of corporations and other assets, there is an increasing need for insurance companies to incorporate these factors into the management of their investments. Failure to address these issues could lead to diminished risk-adjusted returns of their portfolios and limit a company's ability to issue claim payments. Companies should therefore enhance disclosure on how ESG factors, including climate change and natural resource constraints, are incorporated into the investment of policy premiums and affect the portfolio risk."

        "Processing and milling agricultural products requires substantial energy input. While some agricultural products companies generate energy on-site through the direct combustion of fossil fuels and/or biomass, most energy is procured from the electrical grid. Energy consumption contributes to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution. Energy management affects current and future costs of operation. Climate regulation and other sustainability factors could result in higher and/or more volatile electricity and fuel prices, increasing operating costs for agricultural products companies. Therefore, energy efficiency gained through process improvements can lower operating costs. The tradeoff between on-site versus grid-sourced electricity as well as the use of alternative energy can play important roles in influencing both the long-term cost and reliability of a company's energy supply and the extent of regulatory impact from direct versus indirect emissions."

        "Water management relates to a company's direct water usage, the exposure of its operations to water-scarce regions, and its management of wastewater. Companies in the Alcoholic Beverages industry use a large amount of water in their operations, as water is a key input to their finished products. Given alcoholic beverage companies' heavy reliance on large volumes of clean water and the fact that water stress is increasing in different regions globally, companies may be exposed to supply disruptions that could significantly impact operations and add to costs. Companies operating in water-stressed regions that fail to address local water concerns may face further risk of losing their social license to operate. Improving water management through increased efficiency and recycling, particularly in regions with baseline water stress, can lead to lower operating costs, reduced risk, and higher intangible asset value."

        "The Meat, Poultry & Dairy industry generates significant Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both livestock and energy-intensive industrial processes. GHG emissions contribute to climate change and create additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for meat, poultry, and dairy companies due to climate change mitigation policies. The majority of the industry's emissions stem directly from the animals themselves through the release of methane during enteric fermentation, and from manure storage and processing. The direct emissions from raising and producing livestock represent a significant portion of total GHG emissions released among all sources. These emissions sources are currently not widely regulated, which presents uncertainties as to the future of GHG regulations for the industry. Companies in this industry also use large quantities of fossil fuels to meet energy needs, generating additional direct GHG emissions and increasing exposure to regulatory risks. Future emission regulations could result in additional operating and/or compliance costs. By implementing new technologies to capture animal emissions and focusing on energy efficiency, companies can mitigate regulatory risk and volatile energy costs while also limiting their GHG emissions."

Energy generation contributes to environmental impacts, including climate change and pollution, which have the potential to indirectly, yet materially, impact the operations of non-alcoholic beverages companies. Companies can reduce energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their operations by implementing more efficient technologies and processes.

Restaurants located in water-stressed regions may be exposed to water usage restrictions or face high water costs. Long-term historic increases in the costs of water, and expectations around continued increases due to overconsumption and constrained supplies resulting from population growth and shifts, pollution, and climate change, indicate the heightened importance of water management. Companies can reduce water use and associated operational costs through implementing water-efficient practices and using water-efficient commercial kitchen equipment.",

Companies also provide administrative services and network access for self-funded insurance plans and manage pharmacy benefits. Enrollment in managed care has traditionally been correlated with employment rates, while revenues are driven by the inflation of medical costs. Legislative uncertainty and a focus on reducing health care costs may create downward pricing pressure and continue to drive consolidation within the industry. In addition, a focus on patient outcomes and plan performance continue to shape the industry's sustainability risks and opportunities."

Products are used in settings, including hospitals, clinics, and laboratories, and range from disposable items to highly specialized equipment. The increased prevalence of diseases associated with unhealthy lifestyles and an aging population are important factors that may impact growth in this industry. Emerging markets and the expansion of health insurance in the U.S. will contribute to further growth. However, the extension of government insurance programs, provider and payer consolidation, and regulatory emphasis on reduced costs in all markets may result in downward pricing pressure."

        "The manufacturing of computers, computer components, and other electronics requires significant volumes of water. Water is becoming a scarce resource around the globe, due to increasing consumption from population growth and rapid urbanization, and reduced supplies due to climate change. Without careful planning, water scarcity can result in higher supply costs, social tensions with local communities and governments, and/or loss of access to water in water-scarce regions thereby presenting a critical risk to production, and thus revenues. Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) & Original Design Manufacturing (ODM) companies that are able to increase the efficiency of water use during manufacturing can reduce operating costs and maintain a lower risk profile, ultimately impacting cost of capital and market valuation. Furthermore, firms that prioritize reducing water use and greater efficiency can face lower regulatory risks as local, regional, and national environmental laws place increasing emphasis on resource conservation."

        "As a result of its heavy reliance on hydrocarbon fuels, the Airlines industry generates a significant amount of emissions, over 99 percent of which are in the form of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). The industry is thus subject to compliance costs and risks associated with climate change mitigation policies. The main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for airlines companies are aircraft fuel use and emissions, ground equipment, and facility electricity. Aircraft fuel use is the largest contributor to total emissions from the industry, and fuel management is a critical part of reducing emissions. Management of the environmental impacts of fuel usage includes increasing fuel efficiency through fleet upgrades, retrofits, and optimization of flight speed and route design as well as and incorporating alternative and sustainable fuels. These initiatives require capital expenditures, but in the long-run can reduce fuel costs and decrease a company's exposure to the risks of GHG emissions programs and regulations."

The use of electricity and fossil fuels by auto parts manufacturers in their production processes results in direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Purchased electricity represents a major share of the energy used in the Auto Parts industry. Sustainability initiatives such as incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy are making alternative sources of energy more cost-competitive. Regulators and consumers are also pressuring the industry to reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important for companies in energy-intensive industries to manage the cost and reliability risks associated with their overall energy efficiency, their reliance on different types of energy, and their access to alternative energy sources."

        "## Topic Summary",
        "The Rail Transportation industry generates emissions mainly through the combustion of diesel in locomotive engines. Despite relatively low emissions compared to other transportation industries, fuel management has implications for companies in the industry in terms of operating costs and regulatory compliance. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) including carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) are of particular importance to government regulators concerned about climate change. Intensifying regulation of locomotive exhaust emissions and high fuel costs provide incentives for rail companies to invest in fuel efficiency enhancements to manage emissions. This can increase operational efficiency and impact the cost structure of rail companies, with chronic and acute impacts on value and competitive position both within the industry and compared to other modes of transport."

        "The production of steel requires significant quantities of energy, sourced primarily from the direct combustion of fossil fuels as well as energy purchased from the grid. Energy-intense production has implications for climate change and electricity purchases from the grid can result in indirect Scope 2 emissions. The choice between different production processes\u2014electric arc furnaces and integrated basic oxygen furnace\u2014can influence whether a company uses fossil fuels or purchases electricity. This decision, together with the choice between using coal versus natural gas or on-site versus grid-sourced electricity, can play an important role in influencing both the costs and reliability of energy supply. Affordable, easily accessible, and reliable energy is an important competitive factor in this industry, with energy costs accounting for a substantial portion of manufacturing costs. The way in which an iron and steel company manages its overall energy efficiency, its reliance on different types of energy and associated sustainability risks, and its ability to access alternative sources of energy can influence its profitability."
