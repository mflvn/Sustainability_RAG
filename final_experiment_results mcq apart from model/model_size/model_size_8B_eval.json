In contrast, for Water Management, the entity is required to analyze all operations for water risks, identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress, and disclose water withdrawn and consumed in these locations as a percentage of total water withdrawn and consumed.\n\nAnother difference is the scope of disclosure. For Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the scope includes direct emissions from stationary or mobile sources, while for Water Management, the scope includes water withdrawn and consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress.\n\nAdditionally, the metrics and data required for Water Management are more focused on specific parameters of concern, such as arsenic, copper, lead, and total suspended solids, whereas the metrics and data required for Greenhouse Gas Emissions are more focused on the calculation of gross global Scope 1 emissions and the percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations.\n\nOverall, while both topics require the disclosure of metrics and data, the specific requirements and scope of disclosure differ, reflecting the unique challenges and risks associated with each topic.",
