Specifically, they must provide details on their water withdrawal and consumption, water risks, and water management strategies. Additionally, they must analyze their operations for water risks and identify activities that withdraw and consume water in locations with high or extremely high baseline water stress. The disclosure should include the percentage of water withdrawn from sources with high or extremely high baseline water stress, water consumption, and the timelines and mechanisms for achieving water management targets. The IFRS also requires companies to disclose any incidents of non-compliance associated with water quality permits, standards, and regulations. By providing this information, investors and stakeholders can better understand the water management risks and opportunities faced by companies in the Biofuels industry and make more informed decisions.",
