      "rag_response": "The reporting requirements for Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Water Management topics in the Metals & Mining industry share some similarities, but also have distinct differences.\n\nSimilarities:\n\n* Both topics require the disclosure of specific metrics, such as the total amount of energy consumed (EM-MM-130a.1) and the total water withdrawn and consumed (EM-MM-140a.1).\n* Both topics require the entity to disclose the percentage of its operations that are covered under certain regulations or programs, such as emissions-limiting regulations (EM-MM-110a.1) and water quality permits, standards, and regulations (EM-MM-140a.2).\n* Both topics require the entity to disclose incidents of non-compliance, such as violations of emissions regulations (EM-MM-110a.1) and water quality permits, standards, and regulations (EM-MM-140a.2).\n\nDifferences:\n\n* The scope of reporting for Greenhouse Gas Emissions is broader, covering all seven greenhouse gases (GHGs) covered under the Kyoto Protocol, whereas Water Management focuses on water withdrawn and consumed in locations with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress.\n* The metrics required for Greenhouse Gas Emissions are more detailed, including the disclosure of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations, and the calculation of emissions using specific methodologies (EM-MM-110a.1). In contrast, Water Management requires the disclosure of total water withdrawn and consumed, as well as the number of incidents of non-compliance associated with water quality permits, standards, and regulations.\n* The reporting requirements for Greenhouse Gas Emissions are more prescriptive, with specific guidance on calculation methodologies and consolidation of emissions data (EM-MM-110a.1). In contrast, the reporting requirements for Water Management are more general, with less prescriptive guidance on calculation methodologies and data consolidation.\n\nOverall, while both topics require the disclosure of specific metrics and incidents of non-compliance, the reporting requirements for Greenhouse Gas Emissions are more detailed and prescriptive, reflecting the industry's significant contribution to global GHG emissions.",

Environmental risks may include, but are not limited to, ecological impacts, biodiversity impacts, emissions to air, discharges to water, slope disturbance, soil disturbance and erosion, storm water management, waste management, natural resource consumption, and hazardous chemical usage. The entity shall discuss the due diligence practices it employs to assess the environmental risks of projects, where relevant due diligence practices include environmental impact assessments and stakeholder engagement practices. Relevant items to discuss include, but are not limited to: practices to assess the baseline environmental considerations of the project site; feasible, environmentally preferable alternatives for the project; local legal requirements; the protection of biodiversity; use of renewable natural resources; use of hazardous substances; and efficient production, delivery and use of energy. The entity shall discuss the operational practices it employs to the minimize environmental impacts during project siting, design, and construction, which may include, but are not limited to: waste management, reducing biodiversity impacts, emissions to air, discharges to water, natural resource consumption, and hazardous chemical usage. The entity shall describe its approach to operating in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and permits. Relevant items to discuss include, but are not limited to: employee training on relevant regulations and cleanup procedures, quality control processes on project sites, internal mechanisms for reporting and following up on environmental incidents, and maintenance and reporting of accurate data.
